Poem
   Once again, someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies, of two eyes, of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the mirror (at midnight, in the purest fear, in the loss), you haven’t been able to recognize the voice of your dull silence, to see the earthly messages scrawled in the middle of one mad state, when the body is a glass and from ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water.             Desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur. For my thirsty thirst, what can the promise of eyes do? I speak of something not in this world. I speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere.             And I was naked in memory of the white night. Drunk and I made love all night, just like a sick dog.             Sometimes we suffer too much reality in the space of a single night. We get undressed, we’re horrified. We’re aware the mirror sounds like a watch, the mirror from which your cry will pour out, your laceration.             Night opens itself only once. It’s enough. You see. You’ve seen. Fear of being two in the mirror, and suddenly we’re four. We cry, we moan, my fear, my joy more horrible than my fear, my visceral words, my words are keys that lock me into a mirror, with you, but ever alone. And I am well aware what night is made of. We’ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn’t expect this sacrifice, this condemnation of my eyes which have seen. I speak of a discovery: felt the I in sex, sex in the I. I speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant. The purest loss. But who’ll say: you don’t cry anymore at night? Because madness is also a lie. Like night. Like death.        
   All night I hear the noise of water sobbing. All night I make night in me, I make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.            All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out. All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. All night I write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and I check for someone.            The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. Steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. All night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.            All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.            Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.            All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.            All night I ask you why. All night you tell me no.       
   Hell, my ardent sisters, be assured,   Is where we’re bound; we’ll drink the pitch of hell—   We, who have sung the praises of the lord   With every fiber in us, every cell.   We, who did not manage to devote   Our nights to spinning, did not bend and sway   Above a cradle—in a flimsy boat,   Wrapped in a mantle, we’re now borne away.   Every morning, every day, we’d rise   And have the finest Chinese silks to wear;   And we’d strike up the songs of paradise   Around the campfire of a robbers’ lair,   We, careless seamstresses (our seams all ran,   Whether we sewed or not)—yet we have been   Such dancers, we have played the pipes of Pan:   The world was ours, each one of us a queen.   First, scarcely draped in tatters, and disheveled,   Then plaited with a starry diadem;   We’ve been in jails, at banquets we have reveled:   But the rewards of heaven, we’re lost to them,   Lost in nights of starlight, in the garden   Where apple trees from paradise are found.   No, be assured, my gentle girls, my ardent   And lovely sisters, hell is where we’re bound.   
   I am happy living simply:like a clock, or a calendar.Worldly pilgrim, thin,wise—as any creature. To knowthe spirit is my beloved. To come to things—swiftas a ray of light, or a look.To live as I write: spare—the wayGod asks me—and friends do not.1919
   How is your life with that other one?   Simpler, is it? A stroke of the oars   and a long coastline—   and the memory of me   is soon a drifting island   (not in the ocean—in the sky!)   Souls—you will be sisters—   sisters, not lovers.   How is your life with an ordinary   woman? without the god inside her?   The queen supplanted—   How do you breathe now?   Flinch, waking up?   What do you do, poor man?   “Hysterics and interruptions—   enough! I’ll rent my own house!”   How is your life with that other,   you, my own.   Is the breakfast delicious?   (If you get sick, don’t blame me!)   How is it, living with a postcard?   You who stood on Sinai.   How’s your life with a tourist   on Earth? Her rib (do you love her?)   is it to your liking?   How’s life? Do you cough?   Do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind?   How do you live with cheap goods: is the market rising?   How’s kissing plaster-dust?   Are you bored with her new body?   How’s it going, with an earthly woman,   with no sixth sense?                                                            Are you happy?   No? In a shallow pit—how is your life,   my beloved? Hard as mine   with another man?1924   
   A kiss on the forehead—erases misery.   I kiss your forehead.   A kiss on the eyes—lifts sleeplessness.   I kiss your eyes.   A kiss on the lips—is a drink of water.   I kiss your lips.   A kiss on the forehead—erases memory.1917       
      Fair enough: you people have eaten me,   I—wrote you down.   They’ll lay you out on a dinner table,   me—on this desk.   I’ve been happy with little.   There are dishes I’ve never tried.   But you, you people eat slowly, and often;   You eat and eat.   Everything was decided for us   back in the ocean:   Our places of action,   our places of gratitude.   You—with belches, I—with books,   with truffles, you. With pencil, I,   you and your olives, me and my rhyme,   with pickles, you. I, with poems.   At your head—funeral candles   like thick-legged asparagus:   your road out of this world   a dessert table’s striped cloth.   They will smoke Havana cigars   on your left side and your right;   your body will be dressed   in the best Dutch linen.   And—not to waste such expensive cloth,   they will shake you out,   along with the crumbs and bits of food,   into the hole, the grave.   You—stuffed capon, I—pigeon.   Gunpowder, your soul, at the autopsy.   And I will be laid out bare   with only two wings to cover me.Late July 1933   
   When the wind invades the treetops   and the trees agree, shivering   take me, take me, when their   stealthy perfume drifts down to waft   among mortals, they come out in droves:   the boy whose bouncing keys speak a language   all their own, the novice who gets her tricks   from magazine molls (their haughtiness, swirl   of cleats), the gigolo with eyes lowered,   the better to judge his prey, the woman   whose hemlines rise as her age does,   the bad girl whose only remaining option   is to get worse: despite the string of cheats   and lukewarm reactions, she still has   the power to pound, the knack of   funneling her frustration into   the arrogant click of a heel . . .   at this armada of proud, unyielding soldiers   I have cast ferocious stones, holding forth   on barricaded gardens and souls’ communion   until, heaving my bones from garret to gutter   I took to the street and saw it, too, was worthy.   Chasers out for a good time, flirters in   for a life’s catch, strutters so skilled your   lurid designs burn holes, kill the cold   in the pavement, it does not matter   what fever you feed, so long as   you feed it freely; I hid my eyes   but sickness is catching; lovers, permit me entrance.   
       I.    Maggots in the food, maggots in the floorboards,   maggots in the recurring nightmare in which,   lying down with a rugged adonis,   I wake to find him almost nibbled away.   Certainly signs of death are everywhere,   but love is more than combat with worms   and cannot be so glibly explained away;   I do not tremble or knock my knees   to keep the maggots slumbering below ground,   or crush them underfoot by flocking to   everything they are not: raucous gatherings,   stolen kisses. On the contrary,   I come away from parties adoring   what is wormlike in them: the unrisen soufflé,   the precocious boy’s octogenarian sayings,   the drooping lids of the hostess, someone’s   death rattle of a laugh. Certainly love has   commerce with vermin, but it is a friendly   partnership, not a league of discord;   a hacking cough gives proof of a full life,   a passing stranger seems all the stronger   when one foot is sinking quietly into the grave.               II.       But is is this lingering horror of dust   that makes me pull us out of the cold earth   any way I know how: because I strive   for heaven in little rooms, visit you   in order to suck your blood, then spread it   over pipes and daffodils, and shove you   up to the vacant sky, where you hover   like a stone-cold, tedious statue who never dies,   you, poor pawn, are a jack-in-the-box gone haywire,   and I am a grinning humanist with bad dreams.   
   If walking, like wine, only abets a sad mood   let’s try it, I said, and I did:   over these hills that have never known sorrow   no thoughtful moon passes. Dig until a hill is level, and unearth   only earth. Take pride in knowing the chemical makeup   of rain, the sum total of harmful vapors in any sunset.   For if you must drag in the old lines   about suicidal willows, star’s stacked for or against you,   you clutter a limitless, soaring landscape   with your own baggage. Night of love,   day of omens of night, great mountain   of realized hopes, valley where bitter winds   blow the dispossessed into raving lunatics—   what are they but shady projections   of passing whims, vastly oversimplified versions   of something infinitely greater? This vision before you   is nothing but a triad of trees, hills, river,   steadfast and eternal. But soon you start to feel restless   and when, setting out to take a roll of photos,   you note the disturbing absence of a road,   your suavity crumbles: you deafen the sky   and serenade the moon, fall prostrate before pines   saying oh, come back, spirit of the place which,   lifeless without you, blossoms into something   sumptuously more than mediating madness;   come back, massive oaks that await our coming;   to carve initials is to be truly human;   the days are dappled with our passions,   the mountains rise and fall with our glories and follies.   
   I hate the travel logs that tell you   more about the pain than the place,   yet here I am again, narrating       the same old story to myself   time after time. The papers circling   in an alley, watched by a hunchback,       mimic my plans and their preventer;   when an old man treats the drycleaner   to a lengthy sermon on spotting,       I collect it; bloated clouds spell   messages that people stopped hearing   long ago, and as for the hag       who runs at me, arms open, mouth bleeding?   She’s my future, my terrible double.   Always I head out, hot for details,       and always the details start revolving   around brave ingénues who put their   innocent hands in wicked bonfires.       I could never go for ten minutes   without seeing fissures as faces,   and I confess a hopeless weakness       for the types who come back from travels,   gather their fans around and tell them   stories of order or of wonder:       seashores and meadows sometimes get so   muffled and many-voiced that tourists   storm in and do their talking for them—       It’s addictive, magical, vital.   But I’ve observed how, more and more, these   promising outings are becoming       meta-walks and mechanized phrases:   “When I ventured into the outback,   how it blared back echoes of me,       my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness.”   Meanwhile forces of good and evil   squirm and flourish under the carpet,       mocking the visionary moment’s   sweeping appeal. I’ll go on going   out for scenes of horror and pleasure,       but I’ll start pursuing clues leading   to the return of that enormous,   fertile ground between shouting and silence.   
   Meanwhile, meanwhile used to be my limp’s   accompaniment. Meanwhile (as my legs   maneuvered an abyss), a ballet is   beginning, and the dancer’s perfect feet   propel her downstage, where applause is waiting.   Meanwhile a sad man stomps his gloom away   by stomping evenly: one two, one two   means never blue, his motto goes. But I   was born to other paces, different measures;   the roads I take are undulant and lined   with fluid hedges, trees that take a dive   whenever I am near; a bird’s ascent   slows down to an eternal crawl; and when   a doctor’s order takes me to the city   it is a jagged gotham, full of spires   that waver in the sky like falling knives   or silver metronomes. Meanwhile, meanwhile   (the rhythm steadied me) a lover steals   upon his mistress with the quietness   that only flatfeet know. So quietly   that he might just as well have stayed at home,   I add when my self-confidence is at   a high point, and the view is at its best.   And sometimes I have thoughts, before the surge   of meanwhile drowns them out, that limping is   a thing I’d voluntarily take up   if I were just as upright as the rest:   I see myself, erect, stampeding through   a garden’s sturdy, stale geometry   and nearly knocked down by the urge to say   incline, I like your style; ravine, hello;   how many good things share your curvature;   it is the slant of rainfall when the wind   convinces it to drift; it is a sight   that those with level heads and steady feet   miss out on. In a coracle (my new   enthusiasm leads to stories), you   are better, bent; the more you tilt, the more   the water welcomes you, its addled waves   a live reminder of your being there,   its leaping fish a sign that you are still   alert and in command. The clubfoots have   a myth concerning Orpheus’ head,   and though I doubt its authenticity   I like the way it goes: hacked off, the head   was rolling down the river, when a change   came over it—it bobbed, it jumped, it shuddered,   it caught itself in weeds, but struggled free   because of all its energy, and then   its eyes began to come to life, as if   a pretty tune enthralled it even then.   Meanwhile his killers marched away, saying   he had his ups and downs. Of course, of course   to hobble is to hinder: sick is sick,   no matter how you change the second term   to suit your needs. But sometimes I am sure   that when I limp along a crooked street,   my dancing shadow is a model for   the stiffs who hurry past without a sound,   showing them this way, that way, as they reach   the little level huts they call home.   
   Our sweet companions—sharing your bunk and your bed   The versts and the versts and the versts and a hunk of your bread   The wheels' endless round   The rivers, streaming to ground      The road. . .   Oh the heavenly the Gypsy the early dawn light   Remember the breeze in the morning, the steppe silver-bright   Wisps of blue smoke from the rise   And the song of the wise      Gypsy czar. . .   In the dark midnight, under the ancient trees' shroud   We gave you sons as perfect as night, sons   As poor as the night   And the nightingale chirred      Your might. . .   We never stopped you, companions for marvelous hours   Poverty's passions, the impoverished meals we shared   The fierce bonfire's glow   And there, on the carpet below,      Fell stars. . .   
   I’ll fly off to a fjord in Norway,post “Oh the pain” above my doorwayif you insist on going your way,           for this is not a duck.That is what cowards say, and realistswho run away, shun the appeal itsrare white fur holds, although they feel it’s           a rabbit full of pluck.Let’s multiply, let’s twitch our noses,let’s walk among the night’s dark roses,though where the oldest story goes is           a place where tongues might cluck.I’ve had my share of quacks and hisses;whereof mouth cannot speak, it kisses;hop to it, man, and realize this is           a lovely bit of luck.   
            By the time you swear you’re his,    Shivering and sighing,And he vows his passion is    Infinite, undying—Lady, make a note of this:    One of you is lying.             —Dorothy Parker            Or else our drunken tumble was   too true for daylight’s pleasure,too much in vino veritas   troubled the gods of measurewho sent bright draughts of sunshine down   and sobered up my treasure.All night rapacity had come   as naturally as breathing;we nibbled on each other’s necks   like greedy babies teething.How soon an empty bottle makes   one feel a blissful free thing.“Aspirin, aspirin,” he implored;   I fed him several pills,and when he wondered where he was   it gave me frightful chills,but still I told him of the party’s   unexpected thrills.Words woke us up, reflection turned   affection to regret:“After she left me I tried not   to do this, but I getso lonely”...so I showed him out,   warbling “I’m glad we met.”But now I crave the swift return   of scotch-transfigured nights,like Chaplin, horrified by his   rich friend in City Lightswho only recognizes him   from liquor-gladdened heights,sticking a tall glass in the man’s   upstanding hand (the clinkor worse awaits poor tramps like us   if scamps like you won’t think)and meekly scolding, in a voice   weak with nostalgia, “Drink.”   
   The world had fled, with all its silly caresand questionable aches, and in one swoonwe rose above its stupefying airslike flying lovesick pigs up to the moon.     In that blue light where two lives equaled all,     our souls looked down upon a spinning ball.The world returned, and this was a surpriseI raged against like someone on a rack,telling the sun, tears clouding my stunned eyes,give us our splendid isolation back.     I craved third rails, a shot of something strong     when I found out it doesn’t last for long.The world came back and stayed, pain never ended,but when the aches and cares begged for a hand,grew softer in the light we’d made and tended,I finally began to understand    love’s widening third stage, and of the three    this was the most outstanding ecstasy.   
   We had gathered under a tent in the parkfor some words before lunch and after separate mornings,and when—twice—the poet said “capital,”the lightning bolts that followed the nounhad me bolting too; I’d always suspectedGod’s communist leanings, but now I regrettedhow few exchanges we knowbetween craft and climate:imagine a rhyme inciting a rainbow,blood feuds bruising the sky,hymns of forgiveness bringing a softnew light to the faces watching the last act,waltzes and songs and declamations—this would be capital entertainment!—locked in a clinch with open air.But the lightning was as quick as it was loud.The clouds dispersed,and then so did the crowd.   
   The strings, as if they knewthe lovers are about to meet, beginto soar, and when he marches in the doorthey soar some more—half ecstasy, half pain,the musical equivalent of rain—while children who have grown up with one staresteal further looks across a crowded room,as goners tend to do.My father loved it too,warned me at dinner that he’d be a wrecklong before the final trio came(Ja, ja, she sighed, and gave him up forever);he found his Sophie better late than neverand took the fifth about his silent tearsbut like him I’m a softie, with a massivegift for feeling blue.I went with others, threwbouquets and caution to the whirling wind,believing that the rhapsody on stagewould waft its wonders up to our cheap seats;but mirrors can be beautiful fierce cheats,delusions of an over-smitten mind;I relished trouser roles until I hadno petals left to strew.Up, down the avenueI wandered like a ghost, I wondered whya miracle is always a mirage,then plodded home and set back all the clocks,spent hard-won funds installing strong new locks,telling myself if violence like thiscould never sound like violins, I wouldto art, not life, be true.And I am trying tofathom the way I got from there to here,the joy that snuck up when I’d sworn off joy:we’ve made a sterling start, we’ve got a planto watch it on your satin couch downtownand I’ll be there upon the stroke of eight,bearing in my trembling ungloved handa silver rose for you.
