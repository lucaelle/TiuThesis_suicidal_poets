Poem
"   Leaves scarcely breathing   in the black breeze;   the flickering swallow   draws circles in the dusk.       In my loving   dying heart   a twilight is coming,   a last ray, gently reproaching.       And over the evening forest   the bronze moon climbs to its place.   Why has the music stopped?   Why is there such silence?       "
"   The clock-cricket singing,   that’s the fever rustling.   The dry stove hissing,   that’s the fire in red silk.       The teeth of mice milling   the thin supports of life,   that’s the swallow my daughter   who unmoored my boat.       Rain-mumble on the roof—   that’s the fire in black silk.   But even at the bottom of the sea   the bird-cherry will hear ‘good-bye’.       For death is innocent,   and the heart,   all through the nightingale-fever,   however it turns, is still warm.   "
"   Let us praise the twilight of freedom, brothers,   the great year of twilight!   A thick forest of nets has been let down   into the seething waters of night.   O sun, judge, people, desolate   are the years into which you are rising!                           Let us praise the momentous burden   that the people’s leader assumes, in tears.   Let us praise the twilight burden of power,   its weight too great to be borne.   Time, whoever has a heart   will hear your ship going down.       We have roped swallows together   into legions.   Now we can’t see the sun.   Everywhere nature twitters as it moves.   In the deepening twilight the earth swims into the nets   and the sun can’t be seen.       But what can we lose if we try one   groaning, wide, ungainly sweep of the rudder?   The earth swims. Courage,   brothers, as the cleft sea falls back from our plow.   Even as we freeze in Lethe we’ll remember   the ten heavens the earth cost us.       "
"   Let me be in your service   like the others   mumbling predictions,   mouth dry with jealousy.   Parched tongue   thirsting, not even for the word—   for me the dry air is empty   again without you.       I’m not jealous any more   but I want you.   I carry myself like a victim   to the hangman.   I will not call you   either joy or love.   All my own blood is gone.   Something strange paces there now.   Another moment   and I will tell you:   it's not joy but torture   you give me.   I'm drawn to you   as to a crime—   to your ragged mouth,   to the soft bitten cherry.   Come back to me,   I'm frightened without you.   Never had you such power   over me as now.   Everything I desire   appears to me.   I'm not jealous any more.   I'm calling you.       "
"   Whoever kisses time’s ancient nodding head   will remember later, like a loving son,   how the old man lay down to sleep   in the drift of wheat outside the window.   He who has opened the eyes of the age,   two large sleepy apples with inflamed lids,   hears forever after the roar of rivers   swollen with the wasted, lying times.       The age is a despot with two sleepy apples   to see with, and a splendid mouth of earth.   When he dies he’ll sink onto the numb   arm of his son, who’s already senile.   I know the breath growing weaker by the day   Not long not till the simple song   of the wrongs of earth is cut off,   and a tin seal put on the lips.       O life of earth! O dying age!   I’m afraid no one will understand you   but the man with the helpless smile   of one who has lost himself.   O the pain of peeling back the raw eyelids   to look for a lost word, and with lime   slaking in the veins, to hunt   for night herbs for a tribe of strangers!       The age. In the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime   is hardening. Moscow’s sleeping like a wooden coffin.   There’s no escaping the tyrant century.   After all these years the snow still smells of apples.   I want to run away from my own doorstep,   but where? Out in the street it’s dark,   and my conscience glitters ahead of me   like salt strewn on the pavement.       Somehow I’ve got myself set for a short journey   through the back lanes, past thatched eaves, starling houses,   an everyday passer-by, in a flimsy coat,   forever trying to button the lap-robe.   Street after street flashes past,   the frozen runners crunch like apples;   can’t get the button through the button-hole,   it keeps slipping out of my fingers.       The winter night thunders   like iron hardware through the Moscow streets.   Knocks like a frozen fish, or billows in steam,   flashing like a carp in a rosy tea-room.   Moscow is Moscow again. I say hello to her.   ‘Don’t be stern with me; never mind.   I still respect the brotherhood   of the deep frost, and the pike’s justice.’       The pharmacy’s raspberry globe shines onto the snow.   Somewhere an Underwood typewriter’s rattled.   The sleigh-driver’s back, the snow knee-deep,   what more do you want? They won't touch you, won’t kill you.   Beautiful winter, and the goat sky   has crumbled into stars and is burning with milk.   And the lap-robe flaps and rings   like horse-hair against the frozen runners.       And the lanes smoked like kerosene stoves,   swallowed snow, raspberry, ice,   endlessly peeling, like a Soviet sonatina,   recalling nineteen-twenty.   The frost is smelling of apples again.   Could I ever betray to gossip-mongers   the great vow to the Fourth Estate   and oaths solemn enough for tears?       Who else will you kill? Who else will you worship?   What other lie will you dream up?   There’s the Underwood’s cartilage. Hurry, rip out a key,   you’ll find a little bone of a pike.   And in the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime   will melt, and there’ll be sudden blessèd laughter.   But the simple sonatina of typewriters   is only a faint shade of those great sonatas.       "
"   Our lives no longer feel ground under them.   At ten paces you can’t hear our words.       But whenever there’s a snatch of talk   it turns to the Kremlin mountaineer,       the ten thick worms his fingers,   his words like measures of weight,       the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip,   the glitter of his boot-rims.       Ringed with a scum of chicken-necked bosses   he toys with the tributes of half-men.       One whistles, another meouws, a third snivels.   He pokes out his finger and he alone goes boom.       He forges decrees in a line like horseshoes,   One for the groin, one the forehead, temple, eye.       He rolls the executions on his tongue like berries.   He wishes he could hug them like big friends from home.       "
   The bottoms of my shoes         are clean    From walking in the rain   
   In my medicine cabinet   the winter fly   Has died of old age   
   Useless! Useless!    —heavy rain driving   into the sea   
"   The calm,    Cool face of the river   Asked me for a kiss.    "
"      Let America be America again.   Let it be the dream it used to be.   Let it be the pioneer on the plain   Seeking a home where he himself is free.

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—   Let it be that great strong land of love   Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme   That any man be crushed by one above.

"   In what sense                              I am I   a minor observer                                    as in a dream   absorbed in the interior,   a beardless youth                                      unaccountably   remote yet present                                         at the action   reminding me faintly                                             of Prufrock. . . .   a diminutive figure                                        barely discernible   seemingly ageless                                     escapes me.   The original impulse                                           to sing   compressed                           into one exultant note   breaks out                         of the chest-space,   vibrating along                                the shoulders   in the presence                                of full-bodied   womanliness,                             the eyes dark   in the inner scene,                                      the hair long   and black,                           our dark lady,   inmate of courtship.   She does not speak.                                          She is nameless.   The reason for her                                        presence there   is unknown.   A shepherd,                           vaguely associated,   stands                at a distance   under               a birch tree,   causally,                    playing a flute.   Sweetness                        streams across. . . .   also               from the balance   and the position                                   of each,   it issues.   Neither moves.                                  The scene   is not matter                                   that can pall   or diminish.                                   Its secret holds   as fast as I.   As in Giorgione                                   the suspense   is eternal.   "
"            for Kellie Jones, born 16 May 1959            Lately, I've become accustomed to the wayThe ground opens up and envelopes meEach time I go out to walk the dog.Or the broad edged silly music the windMakes when I run for a bus...Things have come to that.And now, each night I count the stars,And each night I get the same number.And when they will not come to be counted,I count the holes they leave.Nobody sings anymore.And then last night, I tiptoed upTo my daughter's room and heard herTalking to someone, and when I openedThe door, there was no one there...Only she on her knees, peeking intoHer own clasped hands.

"   Sad. And it comes      tomorrow. Again, gray, the streaks      of work      shredding the stone      of the pavement, dissolving       with the idea      of singular endeavor.  Herds, the      herds      of suffering intelligences      bunched,      and out of       hearing.

"            October–November 1975            Autobus on Paseo de la Reforma with destination signs: bellas artes insurgentes. Exactamente. Just what’s needed: Insurgent Arts. Poesía Insurgente. This is not it ...   1      Bus to Veracruz via Puebla + Xalapa ... Adobe house by highway, with no roof and one wall, covered with words: la luz del mundo.   2      Passing through Puebla late Sunday afternoon. A band concert in a plaza next to a Ferris wheel — I have passed through many places like this, I have seen the toy trains in many amusement parks. When you’ve seen them all you’ve seen One.   3      Halfway to Xalapa a great white volcano snow peak looms up above the hot altiplano — White god haunting Indian dreams.   4   A boy and three burros run across a stubble field, away from the white mountain. He holds a stick. There is no other way.   5   Deep yellow flowers in the dusk by the road, beds of them stretching away into darkness. A moon the same color comes up.   6   As the bus turns + turns down the winding hill, moon swings wildly from side to side. It has had too many pathetic phallusies written about it to stand still for one more.   7   In Xalapa I am a head taller than anyone else in town — A foot of flesh and two languages separate us.   8   At a stand in the park at the center of Xalapa I eat white corn on the cob with a stick in the end, sprinkled with salt, butter, grated cheese + hot sauce. The dark stone Indian who hands it to me has been standing there three thousand years.   9   I’m taking this trip from Mexico City to the Gulf of Mexico and back without any bag or person — only what I can carry in my pockets. The need for baggage is a form of insecurity.   10   Two hours in this town and I feel I might live forever (foreign places affect me that way). The tall church tower tolls its antique sign: pray.   11   In early morning in the great garden of Xalapa, with its terraces and immense jacaranda trees, pines + palms, there are black birds with cries like bells, and others with hollow wooden voices like gourds knocked together. The great white volcano shimmers far off, unreached by the rising sun.      12   Brown men in white palmetto cowboy hats stand about the fountains in groups of three or four, their voices lost to the hollow-sounding birds. Along a sunlit white stone balustrade, student lovers are studying each other, novios awaiting the day. The sun beats down hot and melts not the mountain.   13   On the bus again to Veracruz, dropping down fast to flat coast. A tropical feeling — suddenly coffee plantation + palms — everything small except the landscape, horses the size of burros, small black avocados, small strong men with machetes — each still saying to himself Me llamo yo.

Frowning      drunk waving moving a hand or lash.      Dancing kneeling reaching out, letting      a hand rest in shadows. Squatting      to drink or pee. Stretching to climb      pulling themselves onto horses near      where there was sea (the old songs      lead you to believe). Riding out      from this town, to another, where      it is also black. Down a road   where people are asleep. Towards      the moon or the shadows of houses.      Towards the songs’ pretended sea.   "

   I am leading a quiet life      in Mike’s Place every day      watching the champs   of the Dante Billiard Parlor      and the French pinball addicts.      I am leading a quiet life      on lower East Broadway.      I am an American.   I was an American boy.   I read the American Boy Magazine      and became a boy scout      in the suburbs.   I thought I was Tom Sawyer      catching crayfish in the Bronx River   and imagining the Mississippi.      I had a baseball mit   and an American Flyer bike.   I delivered the Woman’s Home Companion      at five in the afternoon   or the Herald Trib   at five in the morning.   I still can hear the paper thump      on lost porches.   I had an unhappy childhood.      I saw Lindbergh land.   I looked homeward   and saw no angel.   I got caught stealing pencils   from the Five and Ten Cent Store      the same month I made Eagle Scout.   I chopped trees for the CCC      and sat on them.   I landed in Normandy   in a rowboat that turned over.   I have seen the educated armies   on the beach at Dover.   I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple clouds      shopkeepers rolling up their blinds      at midday   potato salad and dandelions   at anarchist picnics.   I am reading ‘Lorna Doone’   and a life of John Most   terror of the industrialist   a bomb on his desk at all times.   I have seen the garbagemen parade      in the Columbus Day Parade   behind the glib   farting trumpeters.   I have not been out to the Cloisters      in a long time   nor to the Tuileries   but I still keep thinking   of going.   I have seen the garbagemen parade      when it was snowing.   I have eaten hotdogs in ballparks.   I have heard the Gettysburg Address      and the Ginsberg Address.   I like it here   and I won’t go back   where I came from.   I too have ridden boxcars boxcars boxcars.      I have travelled among unknown men.      I have been in Asia   with Noah in the Ark.   I was in India   when Rome was built.   I have been in the Manger   with an Ass.   I have seen the Eternal Distributor      from a White Hill   in South San Francisco   and the Laughing Woman at Loona Park      outside the Fun House   in a great rainstorm   still laughing.   I have heard the sound of revelry      by night.   I have wandered lonely   as a crowd.   I am leading a quiet life   outside of Mike’s Place every day      watching the world walk by   in its curious shoes.   I once started out   to walk around the world   but ended up in Brooklyn.   That Bridge was too much for me.      I have engaged in silence   exile and cunning.   I flew too near the sun   and my wax wings fell off.   I am looking for my Old Man      whom I never knew.   I am looking for the Lost Leader      with whom I flew.   Young men should be explorers.      Home is where one starts from.      But Mother never told me   there’d be scenes like this.   Womb-weary   I rest   I have travelled.   I have seen goof city.   I have seen the mass mess.   I have heard Kid Ory cry.   I have heard a trombone preach.      I have heard Debussy   strained thru a sheet.   I have slept in a hundred islands   where books were trees.      I have heard the birds      that sound like bells.   I have worn grey flannel trousers   and walked upon the beach of hell.   I have dwelt in a hundred cities   where trees were books.   What subways what taxis what cafes!   What women with blind breasts   limbs lost among skyscrapers!   I have seen the statues of heroes   at carrefours.   Danton weeping at a metro entrance   Columbus in Barcelona   pointing Westward up the Ramblas   toward the American Express      Lincoln in his stony chair      And a great Stone Face      in North Dakota.   I know that Columbus      did not invent America.   I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra Pounds.      They should all be freed.      It is long since I was a herdsman.   I am leading a quiet life      in Mike’s Place every day      reading the Classified columns.   I have read the Reader’s Digest   from cover to cover   and noted the close identification   of the United States and the Promised Land   where every coin is marked      In God We Trust   but the dollar bills do not have it   being gods unto themselves.      I read the Want Ads daily      looking for a stone a leaf      an unfound door.   I hear America singing   in the Yellow Pages.   One could never tell   the soul has its rages.   I read the papers every day      and hear humanity amiss   in the sad plethora of print.   I see where Walden Pond has been drained      to make an amusement park.      I see they’re making Melville      eat his whale.   I see another war is coming      but I won’t be there to fight it.      I have read the writing   on the outhouse wall.   I helped Kilroy write it.   I marched up Fifth Avenue   blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon      but hurried back to the Casbah      looking for my dog.   I see a similarity   between dogs and me.   Dogs are the true observers      walking up and down the world      thru the Molloy country.   I have walked down alleys      too narrow for Chryslers.   I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons      in a vacant lot in Astoria.   Ben Shahn never painted them      but they’re there   askew in Astoria.   I have heard the junkman’s obbligato.      I have ridden superhighways      and believed the billboard’s promises      Crossed the Jersey Flats   and seen the Cities of the Plain   And wallowed in the wilds of Westchester   with its roving bands of natives   in stationwagons.   I have seen them.   I am the man.      I was there.      I suffered   somewhat.   I am an American.   I have a passport.   I did not suffer in public.   And I’m too young to die.   I am a selfmade man.   And I have plans for the future.   I am in line      for a top job.   I may be moving on   to Detroit.   I am only temporarily   a tie salesman.   I am a good Joe.   I am an open book   to my boss.   I am a complete mystery   to my closest friends.   I am leading a quiet life   in Mike’s Place every day      contemplating my navel.   I am a part   of the body’s long madness.   I have wandered in various nightwoods.      I have leaned in drunken doorways.   I have written wild stories   without punctuation.   I am the man.   I was there.      I suffered      somewhat.   I have sat in an uneasy chair.   I am a tear of the sun.      I am a hill   where poets run.   I invented the alphabet   after watching the flight of cranes      who made letters with their legs.   I am a lake upon a plain.      I am a word   in a tree.   I am a hill of poetry.      I am a raid   on the inarticulate.   I have dreamt   that all my teeth fell out      but my tongue lived      to tell the tale.   For I am a still   of poetry.   I am a bank of song.      I am a playerpiano   in an abandoned casino      on a seaside esplanade      in a dense fog   still playing.   I see a similarity   between the Laughing Woman   and myself.   I have heard the sound of summer      in the rain.   I have seen girls on boardwalks      have complicated sensations.      I understand their hesitations.   I am a gatherer of fruit.      I have seen how kisses      cause euphoria.   I have risked enchantment.      I have seen the Virgin      in an appletree at Chartres   And Saint Joan burn   at the Bella Union.   I have seen giraffes in junglejims   their necks like love   wound around the iron circumstances      of the world.   I have seen the Venus Aphrodite      armless in her drafty corridor.      I have heard a siren sing      at One Fifth Avenue.   I have seen the White Goddess dancing      in the Rue des Beaux Arts      on the Fourteenth of July      and the Beautiful Dame Without Mercy      picking her nose in Chumley’s.      She did not speak English.      She had yellow hair   and a hoarse voice   I am leading a quiet life      in Mike’s Place every day      watching the pocket pool players      making the minestrone scene      wolfing the macaronis      and I have read somewhere      the Meaning of Existence      yet have forgotten   just exactly where.   But I am the man   And I’ll be there.   And I may cause the lips      of those who are asleep      to speak.   And I may make my notebooks      into sheaves of grass.      And I may write my own      eponymous epitaph   instructing the horsemen      to pass.   
"   Through the black, rushing smoke-bursts, Thick breaks the red flame; All Etna heaves fiercely Her forest-clothed frame. Not here, O Apollo! Are haunts meet for thee. But, where Helicon breaks down In cliff to the sea, Where the moon-silver'd inlets Send far their light voice Up the still vale of Thisbe, O speed, and rejoice! On the sward at the cliff-top Lie strewn the white flocks, On the cliff-side the pigeons Roost deep in the rocks. In the moonlight the shepherds, Soft lull'd by the rills, Lie wrapped in their blankets Asleep on the hills. —What forms are these coming So white through the gloom? What garments out-glistening The gold-flower'd broom? What sweet-breathing presence Out-perfumes the thyme? What voices enrapture The night's balmy prime? 'Tis Apollo comes leading His choir, the Nine. —The leader is fairest, But all are divine. They are lost in the hollows! They stream up again! What seeks on this mountain The glorified train?— They bathe on this mountain, In the spring by their road; Then on to Olympus, Their endless abode. —Whose proase do they mention? Of what is it told?— What will be for ever; What was from of old. First hymn they the Father Of all things; and then, The rest of immortals, The action of men. The day in his hotness, The strife with the palm; The night in her silence, The stars in their calm.    "
"   I The evening comes, the fields are still. The tinkle of the thirsty rill, Unheard all day, ascends again; Deserted is the half-mown plain, Silent the swaths! the ringing wain, The mower's cry, the dog's alarms, All housed within the sleeping farms! The business of the day is done, The last-left haymaker is gone. And from the thyme upon the height, And from the elder-blossom white And pale dog-roses in the hedge, And from the mint-plant in the sedge, In puffs of balm the night-air blows The perfume which the day forgoes. And on the pure horizon far, See, pulsing with the first-born star, The liquid sky above the hill! The evening comes, the fields are still.        Loitering and leaping,        With saunter, with bounds—        Flickering and circling        In files and in rounds—        Gaily their pine-staff green        Tossing in air,        Loose o'er their shoulders white        Showering their hair—        See! the wild Maenads        Break from the wood,        Youth and Iacchus        Maddening their blood.        See! through the quiet land        Rioting they pass—        Fling the fresh heaps about,        Trample the grass.        Tear from the rifled hedge        Garlands, their prize;        Fill with their sports the field,        Fill with their cries.        Shepherd, what ails thee, then?        Shepherd, why mute?        Forth with thy joyous song!        Forth with thy flute!        Tempts not the revel blithe?        Lure not their cries?        Glow not their shoulders smooth?        Melt not their eyes?        Is not, on cheeks like those,        Lovely the flush?        —Ah, so the quiet was!        So was the hush! II The epoch ends, the world is still. The age has talk'd and work'd its fill— The famous orators have shone, The famous poets sung and gone, The famous men of war have fought, The famous speculators thought, The famous players, sculptors, wrought, The famous painters fill'd their wall, The famous critics judged it all. The combatants are parted now— Uphung the spear, unbent the bow, The puissant crown'd, the weak laid low. And in the after-silence sweet, Now strifes are hush'd, our ears doth meet, Ascending pure, the bell-like fame Of this or that down-trodden name, Delicate spirits, push'd away In the hot press of the noon-day. And o'er the plain, where the dead age Did its now silent warfare wage— O'er that wide plain, now wrapt in gloom, Where many a splendour finds its tomb, Many spent fames and fallen mights— The one or two immortal lights Rise slowly up into the sky To shine there everlastingly, Like stars over the bounding hill. The epoch ends, the world is still.        Thundering and bursting        In torrents, in waves—        Carolling and shouting        Over tombs, amid graves—        See! on the cumber'd plain        Clearing a stage,        Scattering the past about,        Comes the new age.        Bards make new poems,        Thinkers new schools,        Statesmen new systems,        Critics new rules.        All things begin again;        Life is their prize;        Earth with their deeds they fill,        Fill with their cries.        Poet, what ails thee, then?        Say, why so mute?        Forth with thy praising voice!        Forth with thy flute!        Loiterer! why sittest thou        Sunk in thy dream?        Tempts not the bright new age?        Shines not its stream?        Look, ah, what genius,        Art, science, wit!        Soldiers like Caesar,        Statesmen like Pitt!        Sculptors like Phidias,        Raphaels in shoals,        Poets like Shakespeare—        Beautiful souls!        See, on their glowing cheeks        Heavenly the flush!         —Ah, so the silence was!        So was the hush! The world but feels the present's spell, The poet feels the past as well; Whatever men have done, might do, Whatever thought, might think it too.    "
"   Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet, Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet! I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll. Yes, yes, we know that we can jest, We know, we know that we can smile! But there's a something in this breast, To which thy light words bring no rest, And thy gay smiles no anodyne. Give me thy hand, and hush awhile, And turn those limpid eyes on mine, And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul. Alas! is even love too weak To unlock the heart, and let it speak? Are even lovers powerless to reveal To one another what indeed they feel? I knew the mass of men conceal'd Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd They would by other men be met With blank indifference, or with blame reproved; I knew they lived and moved Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest Of men, and alien to themselves—and yet The same heart beats in every human breast! But we, my love!—doth a like spell benumb Our hearts, our voices?—must we too be dumb? Ah! well for us, if even we, Even for a moment, can get free Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd; For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd! Fate, which foresaw How frivolous a baby man would be— By what distractions he would be possess'd, How he would pour himself in every strife, And well-nigh change his own identity— That it might keep from his capricious play His genuine self, and force him to obey Even in his own despite his being's law, Bade through the deep recesses of our breast The unregarded river of our life Pursue with indiscernible flow its way; And that we should not see The buried stream, and seem to be Eddying at large in blind uncertainty, Though driving on with it eternally. But often, in the world's most crowded streets, But often, in the din of strife, There rises an unspeakable desire After the knowledge of our buried life; A thirst to spend our fire and restless force In tracking out our true, original course; A longing to inquire Into the mystery of this heart which beats So wild, so deep in us—to know Whence our lives come and where they go. And many a man in his own breast then delves, But deep enough, alas! none ever mines. And we have been on many thousand lines, And we have shown, on each, spirit and power; But hardly have we, for one little hour, Been on our own line, have we been ourselves— Hardly had skill to utter one of all The nameless feelings that course through our breast, But they course on for ever unexpress'd. And long we try in vain to speak and act Our hidden self, and what we say and do Is eloquent, is well—but 't is not true! And then we will no more be rack'd With inward striving, and demand Of all the thousand nothings of the hour Their stupefying power; Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call! Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn, From the soul's subterranean depth upborne As from an infinitely distant land, Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey A melancholy into all our day. Only—but this is rare— When a belovèd hand is laid in ours, When, jaded with the rush and glare Of the interminable hours, Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear, When our world-deafen'd ear Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd— A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast, And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again. The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain, And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know. A man becomes aware of his life's flow, And hears its winding murmur; and he sees The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze. And there arrives a lull in the hot race Wherein he doth for ever chase That flying and elusive shadow, rest. An air of coolness plays upon his face, And an unwonted calm pervades his breast. And then he thinks he knows The hills where his life rose, And the sea where it goes.    "
"   Far, far from here, The Adriatic breaks in a warm bay Among the green Illyrian hills; and there The sunshine in the happy glens is fair, And by the sea, and in the brakes. The grass is cool, the sea-side air Buoyant and fresh, the mountain flowers More virginal and sweet than ours. And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes, Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia, Bask in the glens or on the warm sea-shore, In breathless quiet, after all their ills; Nor do they see their country, nor the place Where the Sphinx lived among the frowning hills, Nor the unhappy palace of their race, Nor Thebes, nor the Ismenus, any more. There those two live, far in the Illyrian brakes! They had stay'd long enough to see, In Thebes, the billow of calamity Over their own dear children roll'd, Curse upon curse, pang upon pang, For years, they sitting helpless in their home, A grey old man and woman; yet of old The Gods had to their marriage come, And at the banquet all the Muses sang. Therefore they did not end their days In sight of blood, but were rapt, far away, To where the west-wind plays, And murmurs of the Adriatic come To those untrodden mountain-lawns; and there Placed safely in changed forms, the pair Wholly forgot their first sad life, and home, And all that Theban woe, and stray For ever through the glens, placid and dumb.   "
"   Mist clogs the sunshine. Smoky dwarf houses Hem me round everywhere; A vague dejection Weighs down my soul. Yet, while I languish, Everywhere countless Prospects unroll themselves, And countless beings Pass countless moods. Far hence, in Asia, On the smooth convent-roofs, On the gilt terraces, Of holy Lassa, Bright shines the sun. Grey time-worn marbles Hold the pure Muses; In their cool gallery, By yellow Tiber, They still look fair. Strange unloved uproar Shrills round their portal; Yet not on Helicon Kept they more cloudless Their noble calm. Through sun-proof alleys In a lone, sand-hemm'd City of Africa, A blind, led beggar, Age-bow'd, asks alms. No bolder robber Erst abode ambush'd Deep in the sandy waste; No clearer eyesight Spied prey afar. Saharan sand-winds Sear'd his keen eyeballs; Spent is the spoil he won. For him the present Holds only pain. Two young, fair lovers, Where the warm June-wind, Fresh from the summer fields Plays fondly round them, Stand, tranced in joy. With sweet, join'd voices, And with eyes brimming: ""Ah,"" they cry, ""Destiny, Prolong the present! Time, stand still here!"" The prompt stern Goddess Shakes her head, frowning; Time gives his hour-glass Its due reversal; Their hour is gone. With weak indulgence Did the just Goddess Lengthen their happiness, She lengthen'd also Distress elsewhere. The hour, whose happy Unalloy'd moments I would eternalise, Ten thousand mourners Well pleased see end. The bleak, stern hour, Whose severe moments I would annihilate, Is pass'd by others In warmth, light, joy. Time, so complain'd of, Who to no one man Shows partiality, Brings round to all men Some undimm'd hours.    "
"   The sea is calm tonight.  The tide is full, the moon lies fair  Upon the straits; on the French coast the light  Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,  Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.  Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!  Only, from the long line of spray  Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,  Listen! you hear the grating roar  Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,  At their return, up the high strand,  Begin, and cease, and then again begin,  With tremulous cadence slow, and bring  The eternal note of sadness in.  Sophocles long ago  Heard it on the Ægean, and it brought  Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow  Of human misery; we  Find also in the sound a thought,  Hearing it by this distant northern sea.  The Sea of Faith  Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore  Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.  But now I only hear  Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,  Retreating, to the breath  Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear  And naked shingles of the world.  Ah, love, let us be true  To one another! for the world, which seems  To lie before us like a land of dreams,  So various, so beautiful, so new,  Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,  Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;  And we are here as on a darkling plain  Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,  Where ignorant armies clash by night.   "
"   Come, dear children, let us away;   Down and away below!   Now my brothers call from the bay,   Now the great winds shoreward blow,   Now the salt tides seaward flow;   Now the wild white horses play,   Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.   Children dear, let us away!   This way, this way!   Call her once before you go—   Call once yet!   In a voice that she will know:   ""Margaret! Margaret!""   Children's voices should be dear   (Call once more) to a mother's ear;   Children's voices, wild with pain—   Surely she will come again!   Call her once and come away;   This way, this way!   ""Mother dear, we cannot stay!   The wild white horses foam and fret.""   Margaret! Margaret!   Come, dear children, come away down;   Call no more!   One last look at the white-wall'd town   And the little grey church on the windy shore,   Then come down!   She will not come though you call all day;   Come away, come away!   Children dear, was it yesterday   We heard the sweet bells over the bay?   In the caverns where we lay,   Through the surf and through the swell,   The far-off sound of a silver bell?   Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,   Where the winds are all asleep;   Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,   Where the salt weed sways in the stream,   Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,   Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;   Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,   Dry their mail and bask in the brine;   Where great whales come sailing by,   Sail and sail, with unshut eye,   Round the world for ever and aye?   When did music come this way?   Children dear, was it yesterday?   Children dear, was it yesterday   (Call yet once) that she went away?   Once she sate with you and me,   On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,   And the youngest sate on her knee.   She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well,   When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.   She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea;   She said: ""I must go, to my kinsfolk pray   In the little grey church on the shore to-day.   'T will be Easter-time in the world—ah me!   And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee.""   I said: ""Go up, dear heart, through the waves;   Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!""   She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.   Children dear, was it yesterday?   Children dear, were we long alone?   ""The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;   Long prayers,"" I said, ""in the world they say;   Come!"" I said; and we rose through the surf in the bay.   We went up the beach, by the sandy down   Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town;   Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,   To the little grey church on the windy hill.   From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,   But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.   We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,   And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.   She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:   ""Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!   Dear heart,"" I said, ""we are long alone;   The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.""   But, ah, she gave me never a look,   For her eyes were seal'd to the holy book!   Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.   Come away, children, call no more!   Come away, come down, call no more!   Down, down, down!   Down to the depths of the sea!   She sits at her wheel in the humming town,   Singing most joyfully.   Hark what she sings: ""O joy, O joy,   For the humming street, and the child with its toy!   For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;   For the wheel where I spun,   And the blessed light of the sun!""   And so she sings her fill,   Singing most joyfully,   Till the spindle drops from her hand,   And the whizzing wheel stands still.   She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,   And over the sand at the sea;   And her eyes are set in a stare;   And anon there breaks a sigh,   And anon there drops a tear,   From a sorrow-clouded eye,   And a heart sorrow-laden,   A long, long sigh;   For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden   And the gleam of her golden hair.   Come away, away children   Come children, come down!   The hoarse wind blows coldly;   Lights shine in the town.   She will start from her slumber   When gusts shake the door;   She will hear the winds howling,   Will hear the waves roar.   We shall see, while above us   The waves roar and whirl,   A ceiling of amber,   A pavement of pearl.   Singing: ""Here came a mortal,   But faithless was she!   And alone dwell for ever   The kings of the sea.""   But, children, at midnight,   When soft the winds blow,   When clear falls the moonlight,   When spring-tides are low;   When sweet airs come seaward   From heaths starr'd with broom,   And high rocks throw mildly   On the blanch'd sands a gloom;   Up the still, glistening beaches,   Up the creeks we will hie,   Over banks of bright seaweed   The ebb-tide leaves dry.   We will gaze, from the sand-hills,   At the white, sleeping town;   At the church on the hill-side—   And then come back down.   Singing: ""There dwells a loved one,   But cruel is she!   She left lonely for ever   The kings of the sea.""   "
"   A wanderer is man from his birth. He was born in a ship On the breast of the river of Time; Brimming with wonder and joy He spreads out his arms to the light, Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream. As what he sees is, so have his thoughts been. Whether he wakes, Where the snowy mountainous pass, Echoing the screams of the eagles, Hems in its gorges the bed Of the new-born clear-flowing stream; Whether he first sees light Where the river in gleaming rings Sluggishly winds through the plain; Whether in sound of the swallowing sea— As is the world on the banks, So is the mind of the man.       Vainly does each, as he glides, Fable and dream Of the lands which the river of Time Had left ere he woke on its breast, Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed. Only the tract where he sails He wots of; only the thoughts, Raised by the objects he passes, are his. Who can see the green earth any more As she was by the sources of Time? Who imagines her fields as they lay In the sunshine, unworn by the plough? Who thinks as they thought, The tribes who then roam'd on her breast, Her vigorous, primitive sons? What girl Now reads in her bosom as clear As Rebekah read, when she sate At eve by the palm-shaded well? Who guards in her breast As deep, as pellucid a spring Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?       What bard, At the height of his vision, can deem Of God, of the world, of the soul, With a plainness as near, As flashing as Moses felt When he lay in the night by his flock On the starlit Arabian waste? Can rise and obey The beck of the Spirit like him? This tract which the river of Time Now flows through with us, is the plain. Gone is the calm of its earlier shore. Border'd by cities and hoarse With a thousand cries is its stream. And we on its breast, our minds Are confused as the cries which we hear, Changing and shot as the sights which we see. And we say that repose has fled For ever the course of the river of Time. That cities will crowd to its edge In a blacker, incessanter line; That the din will be more on its banks, Denser the trade on its stream, Flatter the plain where it flows, Fiercer the sun overhead. That never will those on its breast See an ennobling sight, Drink of the feeling of quiet again. But what was before us we know not, And we know not what shall succeed. Haply, the river of Time— As it grows, as the towns on its marge Fling their wavering lights On a wider, statelier stream— May acquire, if not the calm Of its early mountainous shore, Yet a solemn peace of its own. And the width of the waters, the hush Of the grey expanse where he floats, Freshening its current and spotted with foam As it draws to the Ocean, may strike Peace to the soul of the man on its breast— As the pale waste widens around him, As the banks fade dimmer away, As the stars come out, and the night-wind Brings up the stream Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea.

   What happens to a dream deferred?         Does it dry up         like a raisin in the sun?         Or fester like a sore—         And then run?         Does it stink like rotten meat?

Here is my hand.                            Your age is of no significance.”   Ah!         I move closer to his mouth   and look into his eyes.                                       I do not avert mine,   there is no reason to,                                     or retreat   into a kindly smile.   Ah, companero,                         you were born   on the wrong day                            when God was paradoxical.   You’ll have to                         find yourself an old dog.   "

Their stems were thin and woody   but as tightly compacted                                        as a tree trunk,   greenish rubbings showing in spots                                                       through the brown;   wiry, forked twigs so close,                                              they made an impassable bush   which from a distance                                    looked like mist.   I could barely escape                                    from that wood of particulars ...   the jonquils whose air within                                                was irradiated topaz,   silent as in an ear,                                  the stems leaning lightly   against the glass,                               trisecting its inner circle   in the water,                        crossed like reverent hands   (ah, the imagination!

I was moved by all this                                       and murmured   to my eyes, “Oh, Master!”                                          and became engrossed again   in that wood of particulars                                             until I found myself   out of character, singing            “Tell me why you’ve settled here.”            “Because my element is near.”   and reflecting,                           “The eye of man cares. Yes!”   But a familiar voice                                  broke into the wood,   a shade of mockery in it,                                          and in her smile   a fore-knowledge                            of something playful,   something forbidden,                                  something make-believe   something saucy,                            something delicious   about to pull me                            off guard:   “Do you want to be my Cupid-o?”   In fairness to her                               it must be said   that her freckles                              are always friendly   and that the anticipation                                          of a prank   makes them radiate                               across her face   the way dandelions                               sprout in a field   after a summer shower.   “What makes you so fresh,                                          my Wife of Bath?   What makes you so silly,                                        o bright hen?”   “That’s for you to find out,                                              old shoe, old shoe.   That’s for you to find out                                           if you can.”   “Oh yeah!”                   (a mock chase and capture).   “Commit her                     into jonquil’s custody.   She’ll see a phallus                                  in the pistil.   Let her work it off there.”   But I was now myself                                     under this stringent force   which ended,                      as real pastorals in time must,   in bed, with the great                                     eye of man, rolling.

"   We speak of mankind.   Why not wavekind?   Barrel-chested military water   rushes in a mass   to break the shore earth   into stonekind.Pphlooph pphlooph                                 the waves grope   indistinctly for the shore.   As delicate                     as a butterfly   along a cheek                        a boat with white   and orange sail appears.   A small boy in a life-belt   sits in front and looks ahead   with all his might.                         His father steers,   attached like a shaft   to his son’s safety   and the sail’s management.   A sunfish thrown back by a fisherman   lies drowned and pitching.   The eyes are white in death.   This is the raw data.   A mystery translates it   into feeling and perception;   then imagination;   finally the hard   inevitable quartz   figure of will                         and language.   Thus a squirrel tail flying   from a handlebar   unmistakably establishes   its passing rider   as a male unbowed                            in a chipper plume.   "

"   Who can say now,   “When I was young, the country was very beautiful?   Oaks and willows grew along the rivers   and there were many herbs and flowering bushes.   The forests were so dense the deer slipped through   the cottonwoods and maples unseen.”   Who would listen?   Who will carry even the vicarious tone of that time?   In the old days                           age was honored.   Today it’s whim,                            the whelp without habitat.   Who will now admit                               that he is either old or young   or knows anything?   All that went out with the forests.   "
"   After the jostling on canal streets   and the orchids blowing in the window      I work in cut glass and majolica   and hear the plectrum of the angels.   My thoughts keep dwelling on the littoral      where china clocks tick in the cold shells      and the weeds slide in the equinox.   The night is cold for love,      a chamber for the chorus   and the antistrophe of the sealight.   "
"   I, too, sing America.   I am the darker brother.   They send me to eat in the kitchen   When company comes,   But I laugh,   And eat well,   And grow strong.   Tomorrow,   I’ll be at the table   When company comes.   Nobody’ll dare   Say to me,   “Eat in the kitchen,”   Then.   Besides,   They’ll see how beautiful I am   And be ashamed—   I, too, am America.   "
"   Well, son, I’ll tell you:   Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.   It’s had tacks in it,   And splinters,   And boards torn up,   And places with no carpet on the floor—   Bare.   But all the time   I’se been a-climbin’ on,   And reachin’ landin’s,   And turnin’ corners,   And sometimes goin’ in the dark   Where there ain’t been no light.   So boy, don’t you turn back.   Don’t you set down on the steps   ’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard.   Don’t you fall now—   For I’se still goin’, honey,   I’se still climbin’,   And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.   "
"   What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.             In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations!             What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!—and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?             I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.             I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?             I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.             We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.             Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?             (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)             Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.             Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?             Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?

"            1922: the stone porch of my Grandfather’s summer house            I   “I won’t go with you. I want to stay with Grandpa!”      That’s how I threw cold water   on my Mother and Father’s   watery martini pipe dreams at Sunday dinner.   ... Fontainebleau, Mattapoisett, Puget Sound....      Nowhere was anywhere after a summer   at my Grandfather’s farm.   Diamond-pointed, athirst and Norman,   its alley of poplars   paraded from Grandmother’s rose garden   to a scary stand of virgin pine,   scrub, and paths forever pioneering.   One afternoon in 1922,   I sat on the stone porch, looking through   screens as black-grained as drifting coal.Tockytock, tockytock    clumped our Alpine, Edwardian cuckoo clock,      slung with strangled, wooden game.   Our farmer was cementing a root-house under the hill.      One of my hands was cool on a pile   of black earth, the other warm   on a pile of lime. All about me   were the works of my Grandfather’s hands:   snapshots of his Liberty Bell silver mine;      his high school at Stuttgart am Neckar;    stogie-brown beams; fools’-gold nuggets;   octagonal red tiles,   sweaty with a secret dank, crummy with ant-stale;   a Rocky Mountain chaise longue,      its legs, shellacked saplings.      A pastel-pale Huckleberry Finn      fished with a broom straw in a basin      hollowed out of a millstone.      Like my Grandfather, the décor      was manly, comfortable,   overbearing, disproportioned.   What were those sunflowers? Pumpkins floating shoulder-high?      It was sunset, Sadie and Nellie   bearing pitchers of ice-tea,   oranges, lemons, mint, and peppermints,      and the jug of shandygaff,   which Grandpa made by blending half and half   yeasty, wheezing homemade sarsaparilla with beer.   The farm, entitled Char-de-sa    in the Social Register,   was named for my Grandfather’s children:   Charlotte, Devereux, and Sarah.   No one had died there in my lifetime ...   Only Cinder, our Scottie puppy      paralyzed from gobbling toads.   I sat mixing black earth and lime.II   I was five and a half.   My formal pearl gray shorts   had been worn for three minutes.   My perfection was the Olympian   poise of my models in the imperishable autumn      display windows   of Rogers Peet’s boys’ store below the State House      in Boston. Distorting drops of water   pinpricked my face in the basin’s mirror.   I was a stuffed toucan   with a bibulous, multicolored beak.III   Up in the air   by the lakeview window in the billiards-room,      lurid in the doldrums of the sunset hour,      my Great Aunt Sarah   was learning Samson and Delilah.    She thundered on the keyboard of her dummy piano,   with gauze curtains like a boudoir table,      accordionlike yet soundless.   It had been bought to spare the nerves      of my Grandmother,   tone-deaf, quick as a cricket,   now needing a fourth for “Auction,”      and casting a thirsty eye   on Aunt Sarah, risen like the phoenix   from her bed of troublesome snacks and Tauchnitz classics.   Forty years earlier,   twenty, auburn headed,      grasshopper notes of genius!      Family gossip says Aunt Sarah      tilted her archaic Athenian nose      and jilted an Astor.   Each morning she practiced   on the grand piano at Symphony Hall,   deathlike in the off-season summer—   its naked Greek statues draped with purple      like the saints in Holy Week....   On the recital day, she failed to appear.IV   I picked with a clean finger nail at the blue anchor   on my sailor blouse washed white as a spinnaker.   What in the world was I wishing?   ... A sail-colored horse browsing in the bullrushes ...      A fluff of the west wind puffing      my blouse, kiting me over our seven chimneys,   troubling the waters....   As small as sapphires were the ponds: Quittacus, Snippituit,   and Assawompset, halved by “the Island,”   where my Uncle’s duck blind      floated in a barrage of smoke-clouds.   Double-barreled shotguns   stuck out like bundles of baby crow-bars.   A single sculler in a camouflaged kayak   was quacking to the decoys....   At the cabin between the waters,   the nearest windows were already boarded.      Uncle Devereux was closing camp for the winter.      As if posed for “the engagement photograph,”      he was wearing his severe   war-uniform of a volunteer Canadian officer.   Daylight from the doorway riddled his student posters,      tacked helter-skelter on walls as raw as a boardwalk.      Mr. Punch, a water melon in hockey tights,      was tossing off a decanter of Scotch.   La Belle France in a red, white and blue toga      was accepting the arm of her “protector,”   the ingenu and porcine Edward VII.   The pre-war music hall belles   had goose necks, glorious signatures, beauty-moles,      and coils of hair like rooster tails.   The finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts      being bushwhacked on the veldt—   They were almost life-size....   My Uncle was dying at twenty-nine.   “You are behaving like children,”   said my Grandfather,   when my Uncle and Aunt left their three baby daughters,      and sailed for Europe on a last honeymoon ...      I cowered in terror.   I wasn’t a child at all—   unseen and all-seeing, I was Agrippina   in the Golden House of Nero....   Near me was the white measuring-door   my Grandfather had penciled with my Uncle’s heights.      In 1911, he had stopped growing at just six feet.      While I sat on the tiles,   and dug at the anchor on my sailor blouse,   Uncle Devereux stood behind me.   He was as brushed as Bayard, our riding horse.      His face was putty.   His blue coat and white trousers   grew sharper and straighter.   His coat was a blue jay’s tail,   his trousers were solid cream from the top of the bottle.      He was animated, hierarchical,   like a ginger snap man in a clothes-press.   He was dying of the incurable Hodgkin’s disease....      My hands were warm, then cool, on the piles   of earth and lime,   a black pile and a white pile....      Come winter,   Uncle Devereux would blend to the one color.   "
"            [February 1954]            Your nurse could only speak Italian,   but after twenty minutes I could imagine your final week,      and tears ran down my cheeks....   When I embarked from Italy with my Mother’s body,      the whole shoreline of the Golfo di Genova    was breaking into fiery flower.   The crazy yellow and azure sea-sleds      blasting like jack-hammers across   the spumante-bubbling wake of our liner,      recalled the clashing colors of my Ford.      Mother traveled first-class in the hold;      her Risorgimento black and gold casket      was like Napoleon’s at the Invalides....   While the passengers were tanning      on the Mediterranean in deck-chairs,      our family cemetery in Dunbarton      lay under the White Mountains   in the sub-zero weather.   The graveyard’s soil was changing to stone—   so many of its deaths had been midwinter.      Dour and dark against the blinding snowdrifts,   its black brook and fir trunks were as smooth as masts.   A fence of iron spear-hafts   black-bordered its mostly Colonial grave-slates.      The only “unhistoric” soul to come here      was Father, now buried beneath his recent      unweathered pink-veined slice of marble.      Even the Latin of his Lowell motto:   Occasionem cognosce,    seemed too businesslike and pushing here,      where the burning cold illuminated   the hewn inscriptions of Mother’s relatives:      twenty or thirty Winslows and Starks.   Frost had given their names a diamond edge....   In the grandiloquent lettering on Mother’s coffin,   Lowell had been misspelled LOVEL.   The corpse   was wrapped like panettone in Italian tinfoil.

"   Only teaching on Tuesdays, book-worming   in pajamas fresh from the washer each morning,   I hog a whole house on Boston’s   “hardly passionate Marlborough Street,”   where even the man   scavenging filth in the back alley trash cans,   has two children, a beach wagon, a helpmate,   and is a “young Republican.”   I have a nine months’ daughter,   young enough to be my granddaughter.   Like the sun she rises in her flame-flamingo infants’ wear.   These are the tranquillized Fifties,    and I am forty. Ought I to regret my seedtime?      I was a fire-breathing Catholic C.O.,   and made my manic statement,   telling off the state and president, and then      sat waiting sentence in the bull pen   beside a Negro boy with curlicues   of marijuana in his hair.   Given a year,   I walked on the roof of the West Street Jail, a short      enclosure like my school soccer court,      and saw the Hudson River once a day      through sooty clothesline entanglements      and bleaching khaki tenements.   Strolling, I yammered metaphysics with Abramowitz,   a jaundice-yellow (“it’s really tan”)      and fly-weight pacifist,   so vegetarian,   he wore rope shoes and preferred fallen fruit.      He tried to convert Bioff and Brown,   the Hollywood pimps, to his diet.   Hairy, muscular, suburban,   wearing chocolate double-breasted suits,   they blew their tops and beat him black and blue.   I was so out of things, I’d never heard   of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.   “Are you a C.O.?” I asked a fellow jailbird.      “No,” he answered, “I’m a J.W.”   He taught me the “hospital tuck,”   and pointed out the T-shirted back   of Murder Incorporated’s Czar Lepke,      there piling towels on a rack,   or dawdling off to his little segregated cell full      of things forbidden the common man:   a portable radio, a dresser, two toy American      flags tied together with a ribbon of Easter palm.      Flabby, bald, lobotomized,   he drifted in a sheepish calm,   where no agonizing reappraisal   jarred his concentration on the electric chair—   hanging like an oasis in his air   of lost connections....

"            (1942)       To Denis Devlin            I   Again the native hour lets down the locks      Uncombed and black, but gray the bobbing beard;      Ten years ago His eyes, fierce shuttlecocks,      Pierced the close net of what I failed: I feared      The belly-cold, the grave-clout, that betrayed      Me dithering in the drift of cordial seas;   Ten years are time enough to be dismayed   By mummy Christ, head crammed between his knees.      Suppose I take an arrogant bomber, stroke      By stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear      Sun-ghostlings whisper: Yes, the capital yoke—   Remove it and there’s not a ghost to fear      This crucial day, whose decapitate joke      Languidly winds into the inner ear.II   The day’s at end and there’s nowhere to go,      Draw to the fire, even this fire is dying;      Get up and once again politely lying   Invite the ladies toward the mistletoe   With greedy eyes that stare like an old crow.      How pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang      And how stuffed Santa did his reindeer clang      Above the golden oaken mantel, years ago!   Then hang this picture for a calendar,   As sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly      For the cold martial progress of your star,      With thoughts of commerce and society,      Well-milked Chinese, Negroes who cannot sing,      The Huns gelded and feeding in a ring.III   Give me this day a faith not personal   As follows: The American people fully armed      With assurance policies, righteous and harmed,      Battle the world of which they’re not at all.      That lying boy of ten who stood in the hall,      His hat in hand (thus by his father charmed:      “You may be President”), was not alarmed      Nor even left uneasy by his fall.   Nobody said that he could be a plumber,      Carpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier;      Let little boys go into violent slumber,      Aegean squall and squalor where their fear      Is of an enemy in remote oceans   Unstalked by Christ: these are the better notions.IV   Gay citizen, myself, and thoughtful friend,      Your ghosts are Plato’s Christians in the cave.      Unfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave      Gives back the cheated and light dividend   So long sequestered; now, new-rich, you’ll spend      Flesh for reality inside a stone   Whose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone,      Dead or still living, will not break or bend.   Thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister      And put off like a dog that’s had his day,      You will be Plato’s kept philosopher,   Albino man bleached from the mortal clay,      Mild-mannered, gifted in your master’s ease      While the sun squats upon the waveless seas.   "
"   Cats walk the floor at midnight; that enemy of fog,      The moon, wraps the bedpost in receding stillness; sleep   Collects all weary nothings and lugs away the towers,   The pinnacles of dust that feed the subway.   What stiff unhappy silence waits on sleep   Struts like an officer; tongues next-door bewitch      Themselves with divination; I like a melancholy oaf      Beg the nightly pillow with impossible loves.      And abnegation folds hands, crossed like the knees      Of the complacent tailor, stitches cloaks of mercy      To the backs of obsessions.                                     Winter like spring no less      Tolerates the air; the wild pheasant meets innocently      The gun; night flouts illumination with meagre impudence.   In such serenity of equal fates, why has Narcissus      Urged the brook with questions? Merged with the element   Speculation suffuses the meadow with drops to tickle      The cow’s gullet; grasshoppers drink the rain.      Antiquity breached mortality with myths.   Narcissus is vocabulary. Hermes decorates   A cornice on the Third National Bank. Vocabulary      Becomes confusion, decoration a blight; the Parthenon   In Tennessee stucco, art for the sake of death. Now      (The bedpost receding in stillness) you brush your teeth   “Hitting on all thirty-two;” scholarship pares      The nails of Catullus, sniffs his sheets, restores      His “passionate underwear;” morality disciplines the other   Person; every son-of-a-bitch is Christ, at least Rousseau;   Prospero serves humanity in steam-heated universities, three   Thousand dollars a year. Simplicity, Flamineo, is obscene;   Sunlight topples indignant from the hill.   In every railroad station everywhere every lover      Waits for his train. He cannot hear. The smoke      Thickens. Ticket in hand, he pumps his body      Toward lower six, for one more terse ineffable trip,      His very eyeballs fixed in disarticulation. The berth      Is clean; no elephants, vultures, mice or spiders      Distract him from nonentity: his metaphors are dead.   More sanitation is enough, enough remains: dreams      Do not end—lucidities beyond the stint of thought.      For intellect is a mansion where waste is without drain;   A corpse is your bedfellow, your great-grandfather dines   With you this evening on a cavalry horse. Intellect      Connives with heredity, creates fate as Euclid geometry   By definition:                            The sunlit bones in your house                Are immortal in the titmouse,                They trip the feet of grandma                Like an afterthought each day.                These unseen sunlit bones,             They may be in the cat             That startles them in grandma                But look at this or that             They meet you every way.   For Pelops’ and Tantalus’ successions were at once simpler,   If perplexed, and less subtle than you think. Heredity   Proposes love, love exacts language, and we lack      Language. When shall we speak again? When shall      The sparrow dusting the gutter sing? When shall      This drift with silence meet the sun? When shall I wake?   "
"   I   What is the flesh and blood compounded of      But a few moments in the life of time?      This prowling of the cells, litigious love,      Wears the long claw of flesh-arguing crime.      Consider the first settlers of our bone,      Observe how busily they sued the dust,      Estopped forever by the last dusted stone.      It is a pity that two brothers must   Perceive a canker of perennial flower      To make them brothers in mortality:      Perfect this treason to the murderous hour      If you would win the hard identity   Of brothers—a long race for men to run   Nor quite achieved when the perfection’s won.II   Near to me as perfection in the blood   And more mysterious far, is this, my brother:   A light vaulted into your solitude.   It studied burns lest you its rage should smother.      It is a flame obscure to any eyes,   Most like the fire that warms the deepest grave      (The cold grave is the deepest of our lies)      To which our blood is the indentured slave:      The fire that burns most secretly in you      Does not expend you hidden and alone,   The studious fire consumes not one, but two—   Me also, marrowing the self-same bone.      Our property in fire is death in life   Flawing the rocky fundament with strife.III   Then, brother, you would never think me vain      Or rude, if I should mention dignity;      Think little of it. Dignity’s the stain   Of mortal sin that knows humility.   Let me design the hour when you were born      Since, if that’s vain, it’s only childlike so:      Like an attempting frost on April corn      Considerate death would hardly let you go.   Reckon the cost—if you would validate      Once more our slavery to circumstance      Not by contempt of a prescriptive fate   But in your bearing towards an hour of chance.      It is a part so humble and so proud      You’ll think but little of it in your shroud.IV   The times have changed. Why do you make a fuss      For privilege when there’s no law of form?      Who of our kin was pusillanimous,   A fine bull galloping into a storm?   Why, none; unless you count it arrogance      To cultivate humility in pride,   To look but casually and half-askance   On boots and spurs that went a devil’s ride.      There was, remember, a Virginian   Who took himself to be brute nature’s law,      Cared little what men thought him, a tall man      Who meditated calmly what he saw      Until he freed his Negroes, lest he be      Too strict with nature and than they less free.V   Our elder brother whom we had not seen   These twenty years until you brought him back      From the cyclonic West, where he had been      Sent by the shaking fury in the track      We know so well, wound in these arteries:      You, other brother, I have become strange      To you, and you must study ways to seize      Mortality, that knows how to derange      Corpuscles for designs that it may choose;      Your blood is altered by the sudden death      Of one who of all persons could not use      Life half so well as death. Let’s look beneath      That life. Perhaps hers only is our rest—   To study this, all lifetime may be best.VI   The fire I praise was once perduring flame—   Till it snuffs with our generation out;   No matter, it’s all one, it’s but a name      Not as late honeysuckle half so stout;   So think upon it how the fire burns blue,      Its hottest, when the flame is all but spent;      Thank God the fuel is low, we’ll not renew      That length of flame into our firmament;      Think too the rooftree crackles and will fall      On us, who saw the sacred fury’s height—   Seated in her tall chair, with the black shawl      From head to foot, burning with motherly light      More spectral than November dusk could mix      With sunset, to blaze on her pale crucifix.VII   This message hastens lest we both go down      Scattered, with no character, to death;      Death is untutored, with an ignorant frown      For precious identities of breath.      But you perhaps will say confusion stood,      A vulture, near the heart of all our kin:      I’ve heard the echoes in a dark tangled wood      Yet never saw I a face peering within.      These evils being anonymities,   We fulminate, in exile from the earth,   Aged exclusions of blood memories—   Those superstitions of explosive birth;      Until there’ll be of us not anything   But foolish death, who is confusion’s king.VIII   Not power nor the casual hand of God   Shall keep us whole in our dissevering air,      It is a stink upon this pleasant sod   So foul, the hovering buzzard sees it fair;      I ask you will it end therefore tonight      And the moth tease again the windy flame,   Or spiders, eating their loves, hide in the night      At last, drowsy with self-devouring shame?      Call it the house of Atreus where we live—   Which one of us the Greek perplexed with crime      Questions the future: bring that lucid sieve      To strain the appointed particles of time!      Whether by Corinth or by Thebes we go      The way is brief, but the fixed doom, not so.IX   Captains of industry, your aimless power      Awakens harsh velleities of time:      Let you, brother, captaining your hour   Be zealous that your numbers are all prime,      Lest false division with sly mathematic      Plunder the inner mansion of the blood,   The Thracian, swollen with pride, besiege the Attic—   Invader foraging the sacred wood:   Yet the prime secret whose simplicity      Your towering engine hammers to reduce,      Though driven, holds that bulwark of the sea      Which breached will turn unspeaking fury loose      To drown out him who swears to rectify      Infinity, that has nor ear nor eye.   "
"            An old man in Concord forgets to go to morning service. He falls asleep, while reading Vergil, and dreams that he is Aeneas at the funeral of Pallas, an Italian prince.            The sun is blue and scarlet on my page,      And yuck-a, yuck-a, yuck-a, yuck-a, rage      The yellowhammers mating. Yellow fire      Blankets the captives dancing on their pyre,   And the scorched lictor screams and drops his rod.      Trojans are singing to their drunken God,      Ares. Their helmets catch on fire. Their files      Clank by the body of my comrade—miles      Of filings! Now the scythe-wheeled chariot rolls      Before their lances long as vaulting poles,      And I stand up and heil the thousand men,      Who carry Pallas to the bird-priest. Then      The bird-priest groans, and as his birds foretold,      I greet the body, lip to lip. I hold   The sword that Dido used. It tries to speak,      A bird with Dido’s sworded breast. Its beak      Clangs and ejaculates the Punic word      I hear the bird-priest chirping like a bird.      I groan a little. “Who am I, and why?”      It asks, a boy’s face, though its arrow-eye      Is working from its socket. “Brother, try,      O Child of Aphrodite, try to die:   To die is life.” His harlots hang his bed   With feathers of his long-tailed birds. His head      Is yawning like a person. The plumes blow;      The beard and eyebrows ruffle. Face of snow,      You are the flower that country girls have caught,      A wild bee-pillaged honey-suckle brought      To the returning bridegroom—the design   Has not yet left it, and the petals shine;      The earth, its mother, has, at last, no help:      It is itself. The broken-winded yelp   Of my Phoenician hounds, that fills the brush      With snapping twigs and flying, cannot flush      The ghost of Pallas. But I take his pall,      Stiff with its gold and purple, and recall      How Dido hugged it to her, while she toiled,      Laughing—her golden threads, a serpent coiled      In cypress. Now I lay it like a sheet;   It clinks and settles down upon his feet,   The careless yellow hair that seemed to burn      Beforehand. Left foot, right foot—as they turn,      More pyres are rising: armored horses, bronze,      And gagged Italians, who must file by ones      Across the bitter river, when my thumb      Tightens into their wind-pipes. The beaks drum;   Their headman’s cow-horned death’s-head bites its tongue,      And stiffens, as it eyes the hero slung   Inside his feathered hammock on the crossed      Staves of the eagles that we winged. Our cost      Is nothing to the lovers, whoring Mars      And Venus, father’s lover. Now his car’s      Plumage is ready, and my marshals fetch      His squire, Acoctes, white with age, to hitch      Aethon, the hero’s charger, and its ears      Prick, and it steps and steps, and stately tears      Lather its teeth; and then the harlots bring      The hero’s charms and baton—but the King,      Vain-glorious Turnus, carried off the rest.      “I was myself, but Ares thought it best      The way it happened.” At the end of time,      He sets his spear, as my descendants climb      The knees of Father Time, his beard of scalps,   His scythe, the arc of steel that crowns the Alps.      The elephants of Carthage hold those snows,      Turms of Numidian horse unsling their bows,      The flaming turkey-feathered arrows swarm      Beyond the Alps. “Pallas,” I raise my arm      And shout, “Brother, eternal health. Farewell      Forever.” Church is over, and its bell   Frightens the yellowhammers, as I wake   And watch the whitecaps wrinkle up the lake.      Mother’s great-aunt, who died when I was eight,      Stands by our parlor sabre. “Boy, it’s late.      Vergil must keep the Sabbath.” Eighty years!      It all comes back. My Uncle Charles appears.      Blue-capped and bird-like. Phillips Brooks and Grant      Are frowning at his coffin, and my aunt,      Hearing his colored volunteers parade      Through Concord, laughs, and tells her English maid      To clip his yellow nostril hairs, and fold      His colors on him. . . . It is I. I hold   His sword to keep from falling, for the dust      On the stuffed birds is breathless, for the bust      Of young Augustus weighs on Vergil’s shelf:      It scowls into my glasses at itself.

"            [FOR WARREN WINSLOW, DEAD AT SEA]      Let man have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.             I   A brackish reach of shoal off Madaket—   The sea was still breaking violently and night      Had steamed into our North Atlantic Fleet,   When the drowned sailor clutched the drag-net. Light      Flashed from his matted head and marble feet,      He grappled at the net   With the coiled, hurdling muscles of his thighs:   The corpse was bloodless, a botch of reds and whites,      Its open, staring eyes   Were lustreless dead-lights   Or cabin-windows on a stranded hulk      Heavy with sand. We weight the body, close      Its eyes and heave it seaward whence it came,      Where the heel-headed dogfish barks its nose      On Ahab’s void and forehead; and the name      Is blocked in yellow chalk.   Sailors, who pitch this portent at the sea      Where dreadnaughts shall confess   Its hell-bent deity,   When you are powerless   To sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced   By the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste      In his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute   To pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet      Recoil and then repeat   The hoarse salute.II   Whenever winds are moving and their breath      Heaves at the roped-in bulwarks of this pier,      The terns and sea-gulls tremble at your death      In these home waters. Sailor, can you hear      The Pequod’s sea wings, beating landward, fall      Headlong and break on our Atlantic wall      Off ’Sconset, where the yawing S-boats splash      The bellbuoy, with ballooning spinnakers,      As the entangled, screeching mainsheet clears      The blocks: off Madaket, where lubbers lash      The heavy surf and throw their long lead squids      For blue-fish? Sea-gulls blink their heavy lids      Seaward. The winds’ wings beat upon the stones,      Cousin, and scream for you and the claws rush      At the sea’s throat and wring it in the slush      Of this old Quaker graveyard where the bones      Cry out in the long night for the hurt beast      Bobbing by Ahab’s whaleboats in the East.III   All you recovered from Poseidon died   With you, my cousin, and the harrowed brine      Is fruitless on the blue beard of the god,      Stretching beyond us to the castles in Spain,      Nantucket’s westward haven. To Cape Cod      Guns, cradled on the tide,   Blast the eelgrass about a waterclock   Of bilge and backwash, roil the salt and sand      Lashing earth’s scaffold, rock   Our warships in the hand   Of the great God, where time’s contrition blues      Whatever it was these Quaker sailors lost   In the mad scramble of their lives. They died      When time was open-eyed,   Wooden and childish; only bones abide   There, in the nowhere, where their boats were tossed      Sky-high, where mariners had fabled news      Of IS, the whited monster. What it cost      Them is their secret. In the sperm-whale’s slick      I see the Quakers drown and hear their cry:      “If God himself had not been on our side,      If God himself had not been on our side,      When the Atlantic rose against us, why,      Then it had swallowed us up quick.”IV   This is the end of the whaleroad and the whale   Who spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell      And stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools      To send the Pequod packing off to hell:      This is the end of them, three-quarters fools,      Snatching at straws to sail   Seaward and seaward on the turntail whale,      Spouting out blood and water as it rolls,      Sick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals:Clamavimus, O depths. Let the sea-gulls wail   For water, for the deep where the high tide      Mutters to its hurt self, mutters and ebbs.      Waves wallow in their wash, go out and out,      Leave only the death-rattle of the crabs,      The beach increasing, its enormous snout      Sucking the ocean’s side.   This is the end of running on the waves;   We are poured out like water. Who will dance   The mast-lashed master of Leviathans   Up from this field of Quakers in their unstoned graves?V   When the whale’s viscera go and the roll      Of its corruption overruns this world   Beyond tree-swept Nantucket and Woods Hole      And Martha’s Vineyard, Sailor, will your sword      Whistle and fall and sink into the fat?   In the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat   The bones cry for the blood of the white whale,      The fat flukes arch and whack about its ears,      The death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears      The gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail,   And hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags      And rips the sperm-whale’s midriff into rags,      Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather,      Sailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers      Where the morning stars sing out together   And thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers      The red flag hammered in the mast-head. Hide      Our steel, Jonas Messias, in Thy side.VIOUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM   There once the penitents took off their shoes      And then walked barefoot the remaining mile;      And the small trees, a stream and hedgerows file      Slowly along the munching English lane,      Like cows to the old shrine, until you lose      Track of your dragging pain.   The stream flows down under the druid tree,      Shiloah’s whirlpools gurgle and make glad      The castle of God. Sailor, you were glad      And whistled Sion by that stream. But see:   Our Lady, too small for her canopy,   Sits near the altar. There’s no comeliness      At all or charm in that expressionless   Face with its heavy eyelids. As before,   This face, for centuries a memory,Non est species, neque decor,   Expressionless, expresses God: it goes   Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows,      Not Calvary’s Cross nor crib at Bethlehem      Now, and the world shall come to Walsingham.VII   The empty winds are creaking and the oak      Splatters and splatters on the cenotaph,      The boughs are trembling and a gaff      Bobs on the untimely stroke   Of the greased wash exploding on a shoal-bell      In the old mouth of the Atlantic. It’s well;      Atlantic, you are fouled with the blue sailors,      Sea-monsters, upward angel, downward fish:      Unmarried and corroding, spare of flesh      Mart once of supercilious, wing’d clippers,      Atlantic, where your bell-trap guts its spoil      You could cut the brackish winds with a knife      Here in Nantucket, and cast up the time   When the Lord God formed man from the sea’s slime      And breathed into his face the breath of life,      And blue-lung’d combers lumbered to the kill.      The Lord survives the rainbow of His will.   "
"            For Carl Solomon            I   I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,   dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,   angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,   who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,   who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,   who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,   who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,   who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,   who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,   who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night   with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,   incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,   Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,   who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,   who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,   who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,   a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,   yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,   whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,   who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,   suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,      who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,   who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,   who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,      who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,   who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,   who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,   who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,   who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,   who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,   who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,   who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,   who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,   who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,   who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,   who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,   who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,   who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may,   who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,   who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman’s loom,   who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,   who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,   who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses’ rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,   who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,   who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam-heat and opium,   who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,   who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,   who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,   who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,   who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,   who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,   who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,   who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,   who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,   who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and

tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,   who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even

barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,   who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other’s hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,   who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,   who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver

light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,   who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,   who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,   who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,   who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,   and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong & amnesia,   who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,   returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,   Pilgrim State’s Rockland’s and Greystone’s foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,   with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—   ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really in the total animal soup of time—   and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane,   who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus   to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,   the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,   and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America’s naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio

"   I walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and sat down under the huge shade of a Southern Pacific locomotive to look at the sunset over the box house hills and cry.   Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of machinery.   The oily water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily.   Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust—   —I rushed up enchanted—it was my first sunflower, memories of Blake—my visions—Harlem   and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes Greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms & pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past—   and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye—   corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like a dried wire spiderweb,   leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear,   Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O my soul, I loved you then!   The grime was no man’s grime but death and human locomotives,   all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis’ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt—industrial—modern—all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown—   and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs & sphincters of dynamos—all these   entangled in your mummied roots—and you there standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form!   A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly breeze!   How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your grime, while you cursed the heavens of the railroad and your flower soul?   Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a flower? when did you look at your skin and decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive? the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive?   You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a sunflower!      And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me not!   So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck it at my side like a scepter,   and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack’s soul too, and anyone who’ll listen,   —We’re not our skin of grime, we’re not dread bleak dusty imageless locomotives, we’re golden sunflowers inside, blessed by our own seed & hairy naked accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our own eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening sitdown vision.

"   America I’ve given you all and now I’m nothing.   America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.      I can’t stand my own mind.   America when will we end the human war?   Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.   I don’t feel good don’t bother me.   I won’t write my poem till I’m in my right mind.   America when will you be angelic?   When will you take off your clothes?   When will you look at yourself through the grave?   When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites?   America why are your libraries full of tears?   America when will you send your eggs to India?   I’m sick of your insane demands.   When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?   America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.      Your machinery is too much for me.   You made me want to be a saint.   There must be some other way to settle this argument.      Burroughs is in Tangiers I don’t think he’ll come back it’s sinister.      Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?      I’m trying to come to the point.   I refuse to give up my obsession.   America stop pushing I know what I’m doing.   America the plum blossoms are falling.   I haven’t read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder.   America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies.   America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry.      I smoke marijuana every chance I get.   I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.      When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.      My mind is made up there’s going to be trouble.   You should have seen me reading Marx.   My psychoanalyst thinks I’m perfectly right.   I won’t say the Lord’s Prayer.   I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.   America I still haven’t told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia.   I’m addressing you.   Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?      I’m obsessed by Time Magazine.   I read it every week.   Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.      I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.   It’s always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious. Movie producers are serious. Everybody’s serious but me.      It occurs to me that I am America.   I am talking to myself again.   Asia is rising against me.   I haven’t got a chinaman’s chance.   I’d better consider my national resources.   My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions.   I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.   I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go.   My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I’m a Catholic.   America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood?   I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so they’re all different sexes.   America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe   America free Tom Mooney   America save the Spanish Loyalists   America Sacco & Vanzetti must not die   America I am the Scottsboro boys.   America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in 1835 Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers’ Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy.   America you don’t really want to go to war.   America its them bad Russians.   Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians.      The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia’s power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages.   Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader’s Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations.   That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help.      America this is quite serious.   America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.      America is this correct?   I’d better get right down to the job.   It’s true I don’t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I’m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.   America I’m putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.        Berkeley, January 17, 1956   "

   Let the rain kiss you.   Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops.   Let the rain sing you a lullaby.   The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk.   The rain makes running pools in the gutter.   The rain plays a little sleep-song on our roof at night—   And I love the rain.   
"   What is it to grow old? Is it to lose the glory of the form, The luster of the eye? Is it for beauty to forego her wreath? —Yes, but not this alone. Is it to feel our strength— Not our bloom only, but our strength—decay? Is it to feel each limb Grow stiffer, every function less exact, Each nerve more loosely strung? Yes, this, and more; but not Ah, ’tis not what in youth we dreamed ’twould be! ’Tis not to have our life Mellowed and softened as with sunset glow, A golden day’s decline. ’Tis not to see the world As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes, And heart profoundly stirred; And weep, and feel the fullness of the past, The years that are no more. It is to spend long days And not once feel that we were ever young; It is to add, immured In the hot prison of the present, month To month with weary pain. It is to suffer this, And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel. Deep in our hidden heart Festers the dull remembrance of a change, But no emotion—none. It is—last stage of all— When we are frozen up within, and quite The phantom of ourselves, To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost Which blamed the living man.    "

"   In a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns My love and I plucked poppies breathing tales Of crimes now long asleep, whose once–red stains Dyed stabbing men, at sea with bloody sails. The golden sand drowsed. There a dog yelped loud; And in his cry rattled a hollow note Of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd That loved and bled in winy times remote. The poppies fainted when the moon came wide; The cur lay still. Our passionate review Of red wise folly dreamed on . . . She by my side Stared at the Moon; and then I knew he knew.        And then he smiled at her; to him ’twas funny—        Her calm steel eyes, her earth–old throat of honey!   "
"   I’ve often wondered why she laughed On thinking why I wondered so; It seemed such waste that long white hands Should touch my hands and let them go.   And once when we were parting there, Unseen of anything but trees, I touched her fingers, thoughtfully, For more than simple niceties.   But for some futile things unsaid I should say all is done for us; Yet I have wondered how she smiled Beholding what was cavernous.   "
"   This is the village where the funeral Stilted its dusty march over deep ruts Up the hillside covered with queen’s lace To the patch of weeds known finally to all.   Of her virtues large tongues were loud As I, a stranger, trudged the streets Gay with huckstering: loud whispers from a few Sly wags who squeezed a humor from the shroud.   For this was death. I should never see these men again And yet, like the swiftness of remembered evil— An issue for conscience, say— The cold heart of death was beating in my brain: A new figuration of an old phenomenon.   This is the village where women walk the streets Selling eggs, breasts ungathered, hands like rawhide; Of their virtues the symbol can be washtubs But when they die it is a time of singing,   And then the symbol changes with change of place. Let the wags wag as the pall-bearers climb the hill. Let a new slab look off into the sunset:The night drops down with sullen grace.   "
"   She stands beside me, stands away,      the vague indifference   of her dreams. Dreaming, to go on,      and go on there, like animals fleeing      the rise of the earth. But standing      intangible, my lust a worked anger   a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul.   Then back off, and where you go? Box of words      and pictures. Steel balloons tied to our mouths.      The room fills up, and the house. Street tilts.      City slides, and buildings slide into the river.      What is there left, to destroy? That is not close,      or closer. Leaning away in the angle of language.      Pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross   and flash. It is the lovers pulling down empty structures.      They wait and touch and watch their dreams      eat the morning.   "

"   Alone I stare into the frost’s white face.      It’s going nowhere, and I—from nowhere.      Everything ironed flat, pleated without a wrinkle:      Miraculous, the breathing plain.

"   He came back and shot. He shot him. When he came      back, he shot, and he fell, stumbling, past the      shadow wood, down, shot, dying, dead, to full halt.   At the bottom, bleeding, shot dead. He died then, there      after the fall, the speeding bullet, tore his face      and blood sprayed fine over the killer and the grey light.   Pictures of the dead man, are everywhere. And his spirit      sucks up the light. But he died in darkness darker than      his soul and everything tumbled blindly with him dying   down the stairs.      We have no word   on the killer, except he came back, from somewhere      to do what he did. And shot only once into his victim's   stare, and left him quickly when the blood ran out. We know   the killer was skillful, quick, and silent, and that the victim      probably knew him. Other than that, aside from the caked sourness      of the dead man's expression, and the cool surprise in the fixture   of his hands and fingers, we know nothing.   "

"   Foil'd by our fellow-men, depress'd, outworn, We leave the brutal world to take its way, And, Patience! in another life, we say The world shall be thrust down, and we up-borne. And will not, then, the immortal armies scorn The world's poor, routed leavings? or will they, Who fail'd under the heat of this life's day, Support the fervours of the heavenly morn? No, no! the energy of life may be Kept on after the grave, but not begun; And he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife, From strength to strength advancing—only he, His soul well-knit, and all his battles won, Mounts, and that hardly, to eternal life.

"   We were apart; yet, day by day, I bade my heart more constant be. I bade it keep the world away, And grow a home for only thee; Nor fear'd but thy love likewise grew, Like mine, each day, more tried, more true. The fault was grave! I might have known, What far too soon, alas! I learn'd— The heart can bind itself alone, And faith may oft be unreturn'd. Self-sway'd our feelings ebb and swell— Thou lov'st no more;—Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!—and thou, thou lonely heart, Which never yet without remorse Even for a moment didst depart From thy remote and spher{e}d course To haunt the place where passions reign— Back to thy solitude again! Back! with the conscious thrill of shame Which Luna felt, that summer-night, Flash through her pure immortal frame, When she forsook the starry height To hang over Endymion's sleep Upon the pine-grown Latmian steep. Yet she, chaste queen, had never proved How vain a thing is mortal love, Wandering in Heaven, far removed. But thou hast long had place to prove This truth—to prove, and make thine own: ""Thou hast been, shalt be, art, alone."" Or, if not quite alone, yet they Which touch thee are unmating things— Ocean and clouds and night and day; Lorn autumns and triumphant springs; And life, and others' joy and pain, And love, if love, of happier men. Of happier men—for they, at least, Have dream'd two human hearts might blend In one, and were through faith released From isolation without end Prolong'd; nor knew, although not less Alone than thou, their loneliness.

"   In this lone, open glade I lie, Screen'd by deep boughs on either hand; And at its end, to stay the eye, Those black-crown'd, red-boled pine-trees stand! Birds here make song, each bird has his, Across the girdling city's hum. How green under the boughs it is! How thick the tremulous sheep-cries come! Sometimes a child will cross the glade To take his nurse his broken toy; Sometimes a thrush flit overhead Deep in her unknown day's employ. Here at my feet what wonders pass, What endless, active life is here! What blowing daisies, fragrant grass! An air-stirr'd forest, fresh and clear. Scarce fresher is the mountain-sod Where the tired angler lies, stretch'd out, And, eased of basket and of rod, Counts his day's spoil, the spotted trout. In the huge world, which roars hard by, Be others happy if they can! But in my helpless cradle I Was breathed on by the rural Pan. I, on men's impious uproar hurl'd, Think often, as I hear them rave, That peace has left the upper world And now keeps only in the grave. Yet here is peace for ever new! When I who watch them am away, Still all things in this glade go through The changes of their quiet day. Then to their happy rest they pass! The flowers upclose, the birds are fed, The night comes down upon the grass, The child sleeps warmly in his bed. Calm soul of all things! make it mine To feel, amid the city's jar, That there abides a peace of thine, Man did not make, and cannot mar. The will to neither strive nor cry, The power to feel with others give! Calm, calm me more! nor let me die Before I have begun to live.    "
"   Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece, Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease. But one such death remain'd to come; The last poetic voice is dumb— We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb. When Byron's eyes were shut in death, We bow'd our head and held our breath. He taught us little; but our soul Had felt him like the thunder's roll. With shivering heart the strife we saw Of passion with eternal law; And yet with reverential awe We watch'd the fount of fiery life Which served for that Titanic strife.       When Goethe's death was told, we said: Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head. Physician of the iron age, Goethe has done his pilgrimage. He took the suffering human race, He read each wound, each weakness clear; And struck his finger on the place, And said: Thou ailest here, and here! He look'd on Europe's dying hour Of fitful dream and feverish power; His eye plunged down the weltering strife, The turmoil of expiring life— He said: The end is everywhere, Art still has truth, take refuge there! And he was happy, if to know Causes of things, and far below His feet to see the lurid flow Of terror, and insane distress, And headlong fate, be happiness. And Wordsworth!—Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice! For never has such soothing voice Been to your shadowy world convey'd, Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade Heard the clear song of Orpheus come Through Hades, and the mournful gloom. Wordsworth has gone from us—and ye, Ah, may ye feel his voice as we! He too upon a wintry clime Had fallen—on this iron time Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears. He found us when the age had bound Our souls in its benumbing round; He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears. He laid us as we lay at birth On the cool flowery lap of earth, Smiles broke from us and we had ease; The hills were round us, and the breeze Went o'er the sun-lit fields again; Our foreheads felt the wind and rain. Our youth return'd; for there was shed On spirits that had long been dead, Spirits dried up and closely furl'd, The freshness of the early world. Ah! since dark days still bring to light Man's prudence and man's fiery might, Time may restore us in his course Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force; But where will Europe's latter hour Again find Wordsworth's healing power? Others will teach us how to dare, And against fear our breast to steel; Others will strengthen us to bear— But who, ah! who, will make us feel? The cloud of mortal destiny, Others will front it fearlessly— But who, like him, will put it by? Keep fresh the grass upon his grave, O Rotha, with thy living wave! Sing him thy best! for few or none Hears thy voice right, now he is gone.    "
"   We cannot kindle when we will The fire which in the heart resides; The spirit bloweth and is still, In mystery our soul abides.       But tasks in hours of insight will'd       Can be through hours of gloom fulfill'd.     With aching hands and bleeding feet We dig and heap, lay stone on stone; We bear the burden and the heat Of the long day, and wish 'twere done.       Not till the hours of light return,       All we have built do we discern.     Then, when the clouds are off the soul, When thou dost bask in Nature's eye, Ask, how she view'd thy self-control, Thy struggling, task'd morality—       Nature, whose free, light, cheerful air,       Oft made thee, in thy gloom, despair.     And she, whose censure thou dost dread, Whose eye thou wast afraid to seek, See, on her face a glow is spread, A strong emotion on her cheek!       ""Ah, child!"" she cries, ""that strife divine,       Whence was it, for it is not mine?     ""There is no effort on my brow— I do not strive, I do not weep; I rush with the swift spheres and glow In joy, and when I will, I sleep.       Yet that severe, that earnest air,       I saw, I felt it once—but where?     ""I knew not yet the gauge of time, Nor wore the manacles of space; I felt it in some other clime, I saw it in some other place.       'Twas when the heavenly house I trod,       And lay upon the breast of God.""    "
"   ""Not by the justice that my father spurn'd, Not for the thousands whom my father slew, Altars unfed and temples overturn'd, Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due; Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie, Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny.    ""I will unfold my sentence and my crime. My crime—that, rapt in reverential awe, I sate obedient, in the fiery prime Of youth, self-govern'd, at the feet of Law; Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings, By contemplation of diviner things.    ""My father loved injustice, and lived long; Crown'd with grey hairs he died, and full of sway. I loved the good he scorn'd, and hated wrong— The Gods declare my recompense to-day. I look'd for life more lasting, rule more high; And when six years are measured, lo, I die!    ""Yet surely, O my people, did I deem Man's justice from the all-just Gods was given; A light that from some upper fount did beam, Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven; A light that, shining from the blest abodes, Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods.    ""Mere phantoms of man's self-tormenting heart, Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed! Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart When the duped soul, self-master'd, claims its meed; When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows, Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close!    ""Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers, To spurn man's common lure, life's pleasant things? Seems there no joy in dances crown'd with flowers, Love, free to range, and regal banquetings? Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye, Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy?    ""Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong, Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile, Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and Gods along, Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile? And the great powers we serve, themselves may be Slaves of a tyrannous necessity?    ""Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars, Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight, And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars, Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night? Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen, Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene?    ""Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be, Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream? Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see, Blind divinations of a will supreme; Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom?    ""The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak, My sand runs short; and—as yon star-shot ray, Hemm'd by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak, Now, as the barrier closes, dies away— Even so do past and future intertwine, Blotting this six years' space, which yet is mine.    ""Six years—six little years—six drops of time! Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane, And old men die, and young men pass their prime, And languid pleasure fade and flower again, And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown, Revels more deep, joy keener than their own.    ""Into the silence of the groves and woods I will go forth; though something would I say— Something—yet what, I know not; for the Gods The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay; And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all, And the night waxes, and the shadows fall.    ""Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king! I go, and I return not. But the will Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise, The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.""    —So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn; And one loud cry of grief and of amaze Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake, And turning, left them there; and with brief pause, Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way To the cool region of the groves he loved. There by the river-banks he wander'd on, From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees, Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers; Where in one dream the feverish time of youth Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy Might wander all day long and never tire. Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn, Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down, A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom, From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove, Revealing all the tumult of the feast— Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine; While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon.       It may be that sometimes his wondering soul From the loud joyful laughter of his lips Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems, Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl, Whispering: A little space, and thou art mine! It may be on that joyless feast his eye Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within, Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength, And by that silent knowledge, day by day, Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd. It may be; but not less his brow was smooth, And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom, And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity; Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died In the rich languor of long summer-days; Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall, Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring; No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds.       So six long years he revell'd, night and day. And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came, To tell his wondering people of their king; In the still night, across the steaming flats, Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile.    "
"   Set where the upper streams of Simois flow Was the Palladium, high 'mid rock and wood; And Hector was in Ilium, far below, And fought, and saw it not—but there it stood! It stood, and sun and moonshine rain'd their light On the pure columns of its glen-built hall. Backward and forward roll'd the waves of fight Round Troy—but while this stood, Troy could not fall. So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul. Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air; Cold plashing, past it, crystal waters roll; We visit it by moments, ah, too rare! We shall renew the battle in the plain To-morrow;—red with blood will Xanthus be; Hector and Ajax will be there again, Helen will come upon the wall to see. Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife, And fluctuate 'twixt blind hopes and blind despairs, And fancy that we put forth all our life, And never know how with the soul it fares. Still doth the soul, from its lone fastness high, Upon our life a ruling effluence send. And when it fails, fight as we will, we die; And while it lasts, we cannot wholly end.    "
"   Hark! ah, the nightingale— The tawny-throated! Hark, from that moonlit cedar what a burst! What triumph! hark!—what pain! O wanderer from a Grecian shore, Still, after many years, in distant lands, Still nourishing in thy bewilder'd brain That wild, unquench'd, deep-sunken, old-world pain— Say, will it never heal? And can this fragrant lawn With its cool trees, and night, And the sweet, tranquil Thames, And moonshine, and the dew, To thy rack'd heart and brain Afford no balm? Dost thou to-night behold, Here, through the moonlight on this English grass, The unfriendly palace in the Thracian wild? Dost thou again peruse With hot cheeks and sear'd eyes The too clear web, and thy dumb sister's shame? Dost thou once more assay Thy flight, and feel come over thee, Poor fugitive, the feathery change Once more, and once more seem to make resound With love and hate, triumph and agony, Lone Daulis, and the high Cephissian vale? Listen, Eugenia— How thick the bursts come crowding through the leaves! Again—thou hearest? Eternal passion! Eternal pain!    "
"   Strew on her roses, roses,       And never a spray of yew! In quiet she reposes;       Ah, would that I did too! Her mirth the world required;       She bathed it in smiles of glee. But her heart was tired, tired,       And now they let her be. Her life was turning, turning,       In mazes of heat and sound. But for peace her soul was yearning,       And now peace laps her round. Her cabin'd, ample spirit,       It flutter'd and fail'd for breath. To-night it doth inherit       The vasty hall of death.    "
"   Coldly, sadly descends The autumn-evening. The field Strewn with its dank yellow drifts Of wither'd leaves, and the elms, Fade into dimness apace, Silent;—hardly a shout From a few boys late at their play! The lights come out in the street, In the school-room windows;—but cold, Solemn, unlighted, austere, Through the gathering darkness, arise The chapel-walls, in whose bound Thou, my father! art laid. There thou dost lie, in the gloom Of the autumn evening. But ah! That word, gloom, to my mind Brings thee back, in the light Of thy radiant vigour, again; In the gloom of November we pass'd Days not dark at thy side; Seasons impair'd not the ray Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear. Such thou wast! and I stand In the autumn evening, and think Of bygone autumns with thee. Fifteen years have gone round Since thou arosest to tread, In the summer-morning, the road Of death, at a call unforeseen, Sudden. For fifteen years, We who till then in thy shade Rested as under the boughs Of a mighty oak, have endured Sunshine and rain as we might, Bare, unshaded, alone, Lacking the shelter of thee. O strong soul, by what shore Tarriest thou now? For that force, Surely, has not been left vain! Somewhere, surely afar, In the sounding labour-house vast Of being, is practised that strength, Zealous, beneficent, firm! Yes, in some far-shining sphere, Conscious or not of the past, Still thou performest the word Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live— Prompt, unwearied, as here! Still thou upraisest with zeal The humble good from the ground, Sternly repressest the bad! Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse Those who with half-open eyes Tread the border-land dim 'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st, Succourest!—this was thy work, This was thy life upon earth. What is the course of the life Of mortal men on the earth?— Most men eddy about Here and there—eat and drink, Chatter and love and hate, Gather and squander, are raised Aloft, are hurl'd in the dust, Striving blindly, achieving Nothing; and then they die— Perish;—and no one asks Who or what they have been, More than he asks what waves, In the moonlit solitudes mild Of the midmost Ocean, have swell'd, Foam'd for a moment, and gone. And there are some, whom a thirst Ardent, unquenchable, fires, Not with the crowd to be spent, Not without aim to go round In an eddy of purposeless dust, Effort unmeaning and vain. Ah yes! some of us strive Not without action to die Fruitless, but something to snatch From dull oblivion, nor all Glut the devouring grave! We, we have chosen our path— Path to a clear-purposed goal, Path of advance!—but it leads A long, steep journey, through sunk Gorges, o'er mountains in snow. Cheerful, with friends, we set forth— Then on the height, comes the storm. Thunder crashes from rock To rock, the cataracts reply, Lightnings dazzle our eyes. Roaring torrents have breach'd The track, the stream-bed descends In the place where the wayfarer once Planted his footstep—the spray Boils o'er its borders! aloft The unseen snow-beds dislodge Their hanging ruin; alas, Havoc is made in our train! Friends, who set forth at our side, Falter, are lost in the storm. We, we only are left! With frowning foreheads, with lips Sternly compress'd, we strain on, On—and at nightfall at last Come to the end of our way, To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks; Where the gaunt and taciturn host Stands on the threshold, the wind Shaking his thin white hairs— Holds his lantern to scan Our storm-beat figures, and asks: Whom in our party we bring? Whom we have left in the snow? Sadly we answer: We bring Only ourselves! we lost Sight of the rest in the storm. Hardly ourselves we fought through, Stripp'd, without friends, as we are. Friends, companions, and train, The avalanche swept from our side. But thou woulds't not alone Be saved, my father! alone Conquer and come to thy goal, Leaving the rest in the wild. We were weary, and we Fearful, and we in our march Fain to drop down and to die. Still thou turnedst, and still Beckonedst the trembler, and still Gavest the weary thy hand. If, in the paths of the world, Stones might have wounded thy feet, Toil or dejection have tried Thy spirit, of that we saw Nothing—to us thou wage still Cheerful, and helpful, and firm! Therefore to thee it was given Many to save with thyself; And, at the end of thy day, O faithful shepherd! to come, Bringing thy sheep in thy hand. And through thee I believe In the noble and great who are gone; Pure souls honour'd and blest By former ages, who else— Such, so soulless, so poor, Is the race of men whom I see— Seem'd but a dream of the heart, Seem'd but a cry of desire. Yes! I believe that there lived Others like thee in the past, Not like the men of the crowd Who all round me to-day Bluster or cringe, and make life Hideous, and arid, and vile; But souls temper'd with fire, Fervent, heroic, and good, Helpers and friends of mankind. Servants of God!—or sons Shall I not call you? Because Not as servants ye knew Your Father's innermost mind, His, who unwillingly sees One of his little ones lost— Yours is the praise, if mankind Hath not as yet in its march Fainted, and fallen, and died! See! In the rocks of the world Marches the host of mankind, A feeble, wavering line. Where are they tending?—A God Marshall'd them, gave them their goal. Ah, but the way is so long! Years they have been in the wild! Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks Rising all round, overawe; Factions divide them, their host Threatens to break, to dissolve. —Ah, keep, keep them combined! Else, of the myriads who fill That army, not one shall arrive; Sole they shall stray; in the rocks Stagger for ever in vain, Die one by one in the waste. Then, in such hour of need Of your fainting, dispirited race, Ye, like angels, appear, Radiant with ardour divine! Beacons of hope, ye appear! Languor is not in your heart, Weakness is not in your word, Weariness not on your brow. Ye alight in our van! at your voice, Panic, despair, flee away. Ye move through the ranks, recall The stragglers, refresh the outworn, Praise, re-inspire the brave! Order, courage, return. Eyes rekindling, and prayers, Follow your steps as ye go. Ye fill up the gaps in our files, Strengthen the wavering line, Stablish, continue our march, On, to the bound of the waste, On, to the City of God.    "
"   Weary of myself, and sick of asking What I am, and what I ought to be, At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea. And a look of passionate desire O'er the sea and to the stars I send: ""Ye who from my childhood up have calm'd me, Calm me, ah, compose me to the end! ""Ah, once more,"" I cried, ""ye stars, ye waters, On my heart your mighty charm renew; Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you, Feel my soul becoming vast like you!"" From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven, Over the lit sea's unquiet way, In the rustling night-air came the answer: ""Wouldst thou be as these are? Live as they. ""Unaffrighted by the silence round them, Undistracted by the sights they see, These demand not that the things without them Yield them love, amusement, sympathy. ""And with joy the stars perform their shining, And the sea its long moon-silver'd roll; For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting All the fever of some differing soul. ""Bounded by themselves, and unregardful In what state God's other works may be, In their own tasks all their powers pouring, These attain the mighty life you see."" O air-born voice! long since, severely clear, A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear: ""Resolve to be thyself; and know that he, Who finds himself, loses his misery!""   "
"   Others abide our question. Thou art free. We ask and ask—Thou smilest and art still, Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill, Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty, Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea, Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place, Spares but the cloudy border of his base To the foil'd searching of mortality; And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know, Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure, Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.—Better so! All pains the immortal spirit must endure, All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow, Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.    "
"            An Episode            AND the first grey of morning fill'd the east, And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream. But all the Tartar camp along the stream Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep; Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed; But when the grey dawn stole into his tent, He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword, And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent, And went abroad into the cold wet fog, Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent.       Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere; Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand, And to a hillock came, a little back From the stream's brink—the spot where first a boat, Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land. The men of former times had crown'd the top With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent, A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread. And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent, And found the old man sleeping on his bed Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms. And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep; And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:—       ""Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn. Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?""       But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:— ""Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I. The sun is not yet risen, and the foe Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee. For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son, In Samarcand, before the army march'd; And I will tell thee what my heart desires. Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first I came among the Tartars and bore arms, I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown, At my boy's years, the courage of a man. This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world, And beat the Persians back on every field, I seek one man, one man, and one alone— Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet, Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field, His not unworthy, not inglorious son. So I long hoped, but him I never find. Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask. Let the two armies rest to-day; but I Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords To meet me, man to man; if I prevail, Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall— Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin. Dim is the rumour of a common fight, Where host meets host, and many names are sunk; But of a single combat fame speaks clear.""       He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:—       ""O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine! Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs, And share the battle's common chance with us Who love thee, but must press for ever first, In single fight incurring single risk, To find a father thou hast never seen? That were far best, my son, to stay with us Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war, And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns. But, if this one desire indeed rules all, To seek out Rustum—seek him not through fight! Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms, O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son! But far hence seek him, for he is not here. For now it is not as when I was young, When Rustum was in front of every fray; But now he keeps apart, and sits at home, In Seistan, with Zal, his father old. Whether that his own mighty strength at last Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age, Or in some quarrel with the Persian King. There go!—Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes Danger or death awaits thee on this field. Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace To seek thy father, not seek single fights In vain;—but who can keep the lion's cub From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son? Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.""       So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay; And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet, And threw a white cloak round him, and he took In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword; And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap, Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul; And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd His herald to his side, and went abroad.       The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands. And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed Into the open plain; so Haman bade— Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled The host, and still was in his lusty prime. From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd; As when some grey November morn the files, In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries, Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound For the warm Persian sea-board—so they stream'd. The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard, First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears; Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares. Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south, The Tukas, and the lances of Salore, And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands; Light men and on light steeds, who only drink The acrid milk of camels, and their wells. And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came From far, and a more doubtful service own'd; The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste, Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes, Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere; These all filed out from camp into the plain. And on the other side the Persians form'd;— First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd, The Ilyats of Khorassan, and behind, The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot, Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel. But Peran-Wisa with his herald came, Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front, And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks. And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back, He took his spear, and to the front he came, And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood. And the old Tartar came upon the sand Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:—       ""Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear! Let there be truce between the hosts to-day. But choose a champion from the Persian lords To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.""       As, in the country, on a morn in June, When the dew glistens on the pearled ears, A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy— So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said, A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.       But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool, Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus, That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow; Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow, Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries— In single file they move, and stop their breath, For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows— So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.       And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came, And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host Second, and was the uncle of the King; These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:—       ""Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up, Yet champion have we none to match this youth. He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart. But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart. Him will I seek, and carry to his ear The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name. Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight. Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up.""       So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:— ""Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said! Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.""       He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode Back through the opening squadrons to his tent. But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran, And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd, Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents. Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay, Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around. And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still The table stood before him, charged with food— A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread, And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist, And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand, And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird, And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:—       ""Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight. What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.""       But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:— ""Not now! a time will come to eat and drink, But not to-day; to-day has other needs. The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze; For from the Tartars is a challenge brought To pick a champion from the Persian lords To fight their champion—and thou know'st his name— Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid. O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's! He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart; And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old, Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee. Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!''       He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:— ""Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I Am older; if the young are weak, the King Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo, Himself is young, and honours younger men, And lets the aged moulder to their graves. Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young— The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I. For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame? For would that I myself had such a son, And not that one slight helpless girl I have— A son so famed, so brave, to send to war, And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal, My father, whom the robber Afghans vex, And clip his borders short, and drive his herds, And he has none to guard his weak old age. There would I go, and hang my armour up, And with my great name fence that weak old man, And spend the goodly treasures I have got, And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame, And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings, And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.''       He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:— ""What then, O Rustum, will men say to this, When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks, Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say: Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame, And shuns to peril it with younger men.""      And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:— ""O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words? Thou knowest better words than this to say. What is one more, one less, obscure or famed, Valiant or craven, young or old, to me? Are not they mortal, am not I myself? But who for men of nought would do great deeds? Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame! But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms; Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd In single fight with any mortal man.""       He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy— Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came. But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd His followers in, and bade them bring his arms, And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose Were plain, and on his shield was no device, Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold, And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume. So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse, Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel— Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth, The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once Did in Bokhara by the river find A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home, And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest, Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know. So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd. And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was. And dear as the wet diver to the eyes Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore, By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf, Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night, Having made up his tale of precious pearls, Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands— So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.       And Rustum to the Persian front advanced, And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came. And as afield the reapers cut a swath Down through the middle of a rich man's corn, And on each side are squares of standing corn, And in the midst a stubble, short and bare— So on each side were squares of men, with spears Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand. And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.       As some rich woman, on a winter's morn, Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire— At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn, When the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes— And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was. For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd; Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight, Which in a queen's secluded garden throws Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf, By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound— So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd. And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul As he beheld him coming; and he stood, And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:—       ""O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft, And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold! Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave. Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron, And tried; and I have stood on many a field Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe— Never was that field lost, or that foe saved. O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death? Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come To Iran, and be as my son to me, And fight beneath my banner till I die! There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.""       So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice, The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw His giant figure planted on the sand, Sole, like some single tower, which a chief Hath builded on the waste in former years Against the robbers; and he saw that head, Streak'd with its first grey hairs;—hope filled his soul, And he ran forward and embraced his knees, And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:—       ""O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul! Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?""       But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth, And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:—       ""Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean! False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys. For if I now confess this thing he asks, And hide it not, but say: Rustum is here! He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes, But he will find some pretext not to fight, And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts, A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way. And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall, In Samarcand, he will arise and cry: 'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords To cope with me in single fight; but they Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.' So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud; Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.""       And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:— ""Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield! Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight? Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee! For well I know, that did great Rustum stand Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd, There would be then no talk of fighting more. But being what I am, I tell thee this— Do thou record it in thine inmost soul: Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield, Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods, Oxus in summer wash them all away.""       He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:— ""Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so! I am no girl, to be made pale by words. Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand Here on this field, there were no fighting then. But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here. Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I, And thou art proved, I know, and I am young— But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven. And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know. For we are all, like swimmers in the sea, Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate, Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall. And whether it will heave us up to land, Or whether it will roll us out to sea, Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death, We know not, and no search will make us know; Only the event will teach us in its hour.""       He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came, As on some partridge in the corn a hawk, That long has tower'd in the airy clouds, Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come, And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand, Which it sent flying wide;—then Sohrab threw In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang, The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear. And Rustum seized his club, which none but he Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge, Still rough—like those which men in treeless plains To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers, Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack, And strewn the channels with torn boughs—so huge The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside, Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand. And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand; And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword, And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand; But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword, But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:—       ""Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones. But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I; No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul. Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so! Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul? Boy as I am, I have seen battles too— Have waded foremost in their bloody waves, And heard their hollow roar of dying men; But never was my heart thus touch'd before. Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart? O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven! Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears, And make a truce, and sit upon this sand, And pledge each other in red wine, like friends, And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds. There are enough foes in the Persian host, Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang; Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou Mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear! But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!""       He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen, And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear, Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star, The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms. His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:—       ""Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands! Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words! Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more! Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance; But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance Of battle, and with me, who make no play Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand. Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine! Remember all thy valour; try thy feints And cunning! all the pity I had is gone; Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.""       He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts, And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd Together, as two eagles on one prey Come rushing down together from the clouds, One from the east, one from the west; their shields Dash'd with a clang together, and a din Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters Make often in the forest's heart at morn, Of hewing axes, crashing trees—such blows Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd. And you would say that sun and stars took part In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain, And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair. In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone; For both the on-looking hosts on either hand Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure, And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream. But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin, And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan. Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm, Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume, Never till now defiled, sank to the dust; And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air, And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse, Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;— No horse's cry was that, most like the roar Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side, And comes at night to die upon the sand. The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear, And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream. But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on, And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd His head; but this time all the blade, like glass, Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm, And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone. Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear, And shouted: Rustum!—Sohrab heard that shout, And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step, And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form, And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side. He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground; And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell, And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair— Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet, And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.       Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:— ""Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse, And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent. Or else that the great Rustum would come down Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move His heart to take a gift, and let thee go. And then that all the Tartar host would praise Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame, To glad thy father in his weak old age. Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man! Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.""       And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:— ""Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain. Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man! No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart. For were I match'd with ten such men as thee, And I were that which till to-day I was, They should be lying here, I standing there. But that belovéd name unnerved my arm— That name, and something, I confess, in thee, Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe. And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate. But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear: The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death! My father, whom I seek through all the world, He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!""       As when some hunter in the spring hath found A breeding eagle sitting on her nest, Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake, And pierced her with an arrow as she rose, And follow'd her to find her where she fell Far off;—anon her mate comes winging back From hunting, and a great way off descries His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps Circles above his eyry, with loud screams Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she Lies dying, with the arrow in her side, In some far stony gorge out of his ken, A heap of fluttering feathers—never more Shall the lake glass her, flying over it; Never the black and dripping precipices Echo her stormy scream as she sails by— As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss, So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood Over his dying son, and knew him not.       But, with a cold, incredulous voice, he said:— ""What prate is this of fathers and revenge? The mighty Rustum never had a son.""       And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:— ""Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I. Surely the news will one day reach his ear, Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long, Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here; And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee. Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son! What will that grief, what will that vengeance be? Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen! Yet him I pity not so much, but her, My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells With that old king, her father, who grows grey With age, and rules over the valiant Koords. Her most I pity, who no more will see Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp, With spoils and honour, when the war is done. But a dark rumour will be bruited up, From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear; And then will that defenceless woman learn That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more, But that in battle with a nameless foe, By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.""       He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud, Thinking of her he left, and his own death. He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought. Nor did he yet believe it was his son Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew; For he had had sure tidings that the babe, Which was in Ader-baijan born to him, Had been a puny girl, no boy at all— So that sad mother sent him word, for fear Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms. And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took, By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son; Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame. So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes; For he remember'd his own early youth, And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn, The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries A far, bright city, smitten by the sun, Through many rolling clouds—so Rustum saw His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom; And that old king, her father, who loved well His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child With joy; and all the pleasant life they led, They three, in that long-distant summer-time— The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt And hound, and morn on those delightful hills In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth, Of age and looks to be his own dear son, Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand, Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe Of an unskilful gardener has been cut, Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed, And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom, On the mown, dying grass—so Sohrab lay, Lovely in death, upon the common sand. And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:—       ""O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved! Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men Have told thee false—thou art not Rustum's son. For Rustum had no son; one child he had— But one—a girl; who with her mother now Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us— Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.""       But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath: for now The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce, And he desired to draw forth the steel, And let the blood flow free, and so to die— But first he would convince his stubborn foe; And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:—       ""Man, who art thou who dost deny my words? Truth sits upon the lips of dying men, And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine. I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear That seal which Rustum to my mother gave, That she might prick it on the babe she bore.""       He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks, And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand, That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud; And to his heart he press'd the other hand, And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:—       ""Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie! If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.""       Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm, And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points Prick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin, Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase, An emperor's gift—at early morn he paints, And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands— So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal. It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal, Rustum's great father, whom they left to die, A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks; Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved— Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign. And Sohrab bared that image on his arm, And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes, And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:—       ""How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?""       He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry: O boy—thy father!—and his voice choked there. And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes, And his head swam, and he sank down to earth. But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips, And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks, Trying to call him back to life; and life Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes, And they stood wide with horror; and he seized In both his hands the dust which lay around, And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,— His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms; And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast, And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword, To draw it, and for ever let life out. But Sohrab saw his thoughts, and held his hands And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:—       ""Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day The doom which at my birth was written down In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand. Surely my heart cried out that it was thou, When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too, I know it! but fate trod those promptings down Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear. But let us speak no more of this! I find My father; let me feel that I have found! Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks, And wash them with thy tears, and say: My son! Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life, And swift; for like the lightning to this field I came, and like the wind I go away— Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind. But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.""       So said he, and his voice released the heart Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud, And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts, When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse, With his head bowing to the ground and mane Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe First to the one then to the other moved His head, as if enquiring what their grief Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes, The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand. But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:—       ""Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet Should first have rotted on their nimble joints, Or ere they brought thy master to this field!""       But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;— ""Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed, My terrible father's terrible horse! and said, That I should one day find thy lord and thee. Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane! O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I; For thou has gone where I shall never go, And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home. And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan, And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food, Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine, And said; O Ruksh! bear Rustrum well!—but I Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face, Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan, Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream; But lodged among my father's foes, and seen Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand, Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste, And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend, Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep, The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream, The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.""       Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:— ""Oh, that its waves were flowing over me! Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt Roll, tumbling in the current o'er my head!""       But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:— ""Desire not that, my father! thou must live. For some are born to do great deeds, and live, As some are born to be obscured, and die. Do thou the deeds I die too young to do, And reap a second glory in thine age; Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine. But come! thou seest this great host of men Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these! Let me entreat for them; what have they done? They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star. Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace. But me thou must bear hence, not send with them, But carry me with thee to Seistan, And place me on a bed, and mourn for me, Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends. And thou must lay me in that lovely earth, And heap a stately mound above my bones, And plant a far-seen pillar over all. That so the passing horseman on the waste May see my tomb a great way off, and cry: Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there, Whom his great father did in ignorance kill! And I be not forgotten in my grave.""       And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:— ""Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son, So shall it be; for I will burn my tents, And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me, And carry thee away to Seistan, And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee, With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends. And I will lay thee in the lovely earth, And heap a stately mound above thy bones, And plant a far-seen pillar over all, And men shall not forget thee in thy grave. And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go! Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace! What should I do with slaying any more? For would that all whom I have ever slain Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes, And they who were call'd champions in their time, And through whose death I won that fame I have— And I were nothing but a common man, A poor, mean soldier, and without renown, So thou mightest live too, my son, my son! Or rather would that I, even I myself, Might now be lying on this bloody sand, Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine, Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou; And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan; And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine; And say: O son, I weep thee not too sore, For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end! But now in blood and battles was my youth, And full of blood and battles is my age, And I shall never end this life of blood.""       Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:— ""A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man! But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now, Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day, When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship, Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo, Returning home over the salt blue sea, From laying thy dear master in his grave.""       And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:— ""Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea! Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.""       He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood Came welling from the open gash, and life Flow'd with the stream;—all down his cold white side The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd, Like the soil'd tissue of white violets Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank, By children whom their nurses call with haste Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low, His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay— White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps, Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame, Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them, And fix'd them feebly on his father's face; Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs Unwillingly the spirit fled away, Regretting the warm mansion which it left, And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.       So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead; And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son. As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side— So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.       And night came down over the solemn waste, And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair, And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night, Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose, As of a great assembly loosed, and fires Began to twinkle through the fog; for now Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal; The Persians took it on the open sands Southward, the Tartars by the river marge; And Rustum and his son were left alone.       But the majestic river floated on, Out of the mist and hum of that low land, Into the frosty starlight, and there moved, Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste, Under the solitary moon;—he flow'd Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè, Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin To hem his watery march, and dam his streams, And split his currents; that for many a league The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles— Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere, A foil'd circuitous wanderer—till at last The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide His luminous home of waters opens, bright And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.    "
"   Through Alpine meadows soft-suffused With rain, where thick the crocus blows, Past the dark forges long disused, The mule-track from Saint Laurent goes. The bridge is cross'd, and slow we ride, Through forest, up the mountain-side. The autumnal evening darkens round, The wind is up, and drives the rain; While, hark! far down, with strangled sound Doth the Dead Guier's stream complain, Where that wet smoke, among the woods, Over his boiling cauldron broods. Swift rush the spectral vapours white Past limestone scars with ragged pines, Showing—then blotting from our sight!— Halt—through the cloud-drift something shines! High in the valley, wet and drear, The huts of Courrerie appear. Strike leftward! cries our guide; and higher Mounts up the stony forest-way. At last the encircling trees retire; Look! through the showery twilight grey What pointed roofs are these advance?— A palace of the Kings of France? Approach, for what we seek is here! Alight, and sparely sup, and wait For rest in this outbuilding near; Then cross the sward and reach that gate. Knock; pass the wicket! Thou art come To the Carthusians' world-famed home. The silent courts, where night and day Into their stone-carved basins cold The splashing icy fountains play— The humid corridors behold! Where, ghostlike in the deepening night, Cowl'd forms brush by in gleaming white. The chapel, where no organ's peal Invests the stern and naked prayer— With penitential cries they kneel And wrestle; rising then, with bare And white uplifted faces stand, Passing the Host from hand to hand; Each takes, and then his visage wan Is buried in his cowl once more. The cells!—the suffering Son of Man Upon the wall—the knee-worn floor— And where they sleep, that wooden bed, Which shall their coffin be, when dead! The library, where tract and tome Not to feed priestly pride are there, To hymn the conquering march of Rome, Nor yet to amuse, as ours are! They paint of souls the inner strife, Their drops of blood, their death in life. The garden, overgrown—yet mild, See, fragrant herbs are flowering there! Strong children of the Alpine wild Whose culture is the brethren's care; Of human tasks their only one, And cheerful works beneath the sun. Those halls, too, destined to contain Each its own pilgrim-host of old, From England, Germany, or Spain— All are before me! I behold The House, the Brotherhood austere! —And what am I, that I am here? For rigorous teachers seized my youth, And purged its faith, and trimm'd its fire, Show'd me the high, white star of Truth, There bade me gaze, and there aspire. Even now their whispers pierce the gloom: What dost thou in this living tomb? Forgive me, masters of the mind! At whose behest I long ago So much unlearnt, so much resign'd— I come not here to be your foe! I seek these anchorites, not in ruth, To curse and to deny your truth; Not as their friend, or child, I speak! But as, on some far northern strand, Thinking of his own Gods, a Greek In pity and mournful awe might stand Before some fallen Runic stone— For both were faiths, and both are gone. Wandering between two worlds, one dead, The other powerless to be born, With nowhere yet to rest my head, Like these, on earth I wait forlorn. Their faith, my tears, the world deride— I come to shed them at their side. Oh, hide me in your gloom profound, Ye solemn seats of holy pain! Take me, cowl'd forms, and fence me round, Till I possess my soul again; Till free my thoughts before me roll, Not chafed by hourly false control! For the world cries your faith is now But a dead time's exploded dream; My melancholy, sciolists say, Is a pass'd mode, an outworn theme— As if the world had ever had A faith, or sciolists been sad! Ah, if it be pass'd, take away, At least, the restlessness, the pain; Be man henceforth no more a prey To these out-dated stings again! The nobleness of grief is gone Ah, leave us not the fret alone! But—if you cannot give us ease— Last of the race of them who grieve Here leave us to die out with these Last of the people who believe! Silent, while years engrave the brow; Silent—the best are silent now. Achilles ponders in his tent, The kings of modern thought are dumb, Silent they are though not content, And wait to see the future come. They have the grief men had of yore, But they contend and cry no more. Our fathers water'd with their tears This sea of time whereon we sail, Their voices were in all men's ears We pass'd within their puissant hail. Still the same ocean round us raves, But we stand mute, and watch the waves. For what avail'd it, all the noise And outcry of the former men?— Say, have their sons achieved more joys, Say, is life lighter now than then? The sufferers died, they left their pain— The pangs which tortured them remain. What helps it now, that Byron bore, With haughty scorn which mock'd the smart, Through Europe to the Ætolian shore The pageant of his bleeding heart? That thousands counted every groan, And Europe made his woe her own? What boots it, Shelley! that the breeze Carried thy lovely wail away, Musical through Italian trees Which fringe thy soft blue Spezzian bay? Inheritors of thy distress Have restless hearts one throb the less? Or are we easier, to have read, O Obermann! the sad, stern page, Which tells us how thou hidd'st thy head From the fierce tempest of thine age In the lone brakes of Fontainebleau, Or chalets near the Alpine snow? Ye slumber in your silent grave!— The world, which for an idle day Grace to your mood of sadness gave, Long since hath flung her weeds away. The eternal trifler breaks your spell; But we—we learned your lore too well! Years hence, perhaps, may dawn an age, More fortunate, alas! than we, Which without hardness will be sage, And gay without frivolity. Sons of the world, oh, speed those years; But, while we wait, allow our tears! Allow them! We admire with awe The exulting thunder of your race; You give the universe your law, You triumph over time and space! Your pride of life, your tireless powers, We laud them, but they are not ours. We are like children rear'd in shade Beneath some old-world abbey wall, Forgotten in a forest-glade, And secret from the eyes of all. Deep, deep the greenwood round them waves, Their abbey, and its close of graves! But, where the road runs near the stream, Oft through the trees they catch a glance Of passing troops in the sun's beam— Pennon, and plume, and flashing lance! Forth to the world those soldiers fare, To life, to cities, and to war! And through the wood, another way, Faint bugle-notes from far are borne, Where hunters gather, staghounds bay, Round some fair forest-lodge at morn. Gay dames are there, in sylvan green; Laughter and cries—those notes between! The banners flashing through the trees Make their blood dance and chain their eyes; That bugle-music on the breeze Arrests them with a charm'd surprise. Banner by turns and bugle woo: Ye shy recluses, follow too! O children, what do ye reply?— ""Action and pleasure, will ye roam Through these secluded dells to cry And call us?—but too late ye come! Too late for us your call ye blow, Whose bent was taken long ago. ""Long since we pace this shadow'd nave; We watch those yellow tapers shine, Emblems of hope over the grave, In the high altar's depth divine; The organ carries to our ear Its accents of another sphere. ""Fenced early in this cloistral round Of reverie, of shade, of prayer, How should we grow in other ground? How can we flower in foreign air? —Pass, banners, pass, and bugles, cease; And leave our desert to its peace!""   "
"   Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill; Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes!       No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed, Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,       Nor the cropp'd herbage shoot another head.            But when the fields are still, And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,       And only the white sheep are sometimes seen       Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch'd green. Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest! Here, where the reaper was at work of late— In this high field's dark corner, where he leaves       His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse, And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,       Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use—            Here will I sit and wait, While to my ear from uplands far away       The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,       With distant cries of reapers in the corn— All the live murmur of a summer's day. Screen'd is this nook o'er the high, half-reap'd field, And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be.       Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep, And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see       Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;            And air-swept lindens yield Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers       Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,       And bower me from the August sun with shade; And the eye travels down to Oxford's towers. And near me on the grass lies Glanvil's book— Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!       The story of the Oxford scholar poor, Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,       Who, tired of knocking at preferment's door,            One summer-morn forsook His friends, and went to learn the gipsy-lore,       And roam'd the world with that wild brotherhood,       And came, as most men deem'd, to little good, But came to Oxford and his friends no more. But once, years after, in the country-lanes, Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,       Met him, and of his way of life enquired; Whereat he answer'd, that the gipsy-crew,       His mates, had arts to rule as they desired            The workings of men's brains, And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.       ""And I,"" he said, ""the secret of their art,       When fully learn'd, will to the world impart; But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill."" This said, he left them, and return'd no more.— But rumours hung about the country-side,       That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray, Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,       In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,            The same the gipsies wore. Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;       At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,       On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock'd boors Had found him seated at their entering, But, 'mid their drink and clatter, he would fly. And I myself seem half to know thy looks,       And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace; And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks       I ask if thou hast pass'd their quiet place;            Or in my boat I lie Moor'd to the cool bank in the summer-heats,       'Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,       And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills, And wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats. For most, I know, thou lov'st retired ground! Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,       Returning home on summer-nights, have met    Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,       Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,            As the punt's rope chops round; And leaning backward in a pensive dream,       And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers       Pluck'd in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers, And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream. And then they land, and thou art seen no more!— Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come       To dance around the Fyfield elm in May, Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,       Or cross a stile into the public way.            Oft thou hast given them store Of flowers—the frail-leaf'd, white anemony,       Dark bluebells drench'd with dews of summer eves,       And purple orchises with spotted leaves— But none hath words she can report of thee. And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time's here In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,       Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass Where black-wing'd swallows haunt the glittering Thames,       To bathe in the abandon'd lasher pass,            Have often pass'd thee near Sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown;       Mark'd thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,       Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air— But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone! At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills, Where at her open door the housewife darns,       Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.       Children, who early range these slopes and late            For cresses from the rills, Have known thee eyeing, all an April-day,       The springing pasture and the feeding kine;       And mark'd thee, when the stars come out and shine, Through the long dewy grass move slow away. In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood— Where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way       Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see With scarlet patches tagg'd and shreds of grey,       Above the forest-ground called Thessaly—            The blackbird, picking food, Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;       So often has he known thee past him stray,       Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither'd spray, And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall. And once, in winter, on the causeway chill Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,       Have I not pass'd thee on the wooden bridge, Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,       Thy face tow'rd Hinksey and its wintry ridge?            And thou has climb'd the hill, And gain'd the white brow of the Cumner range;       Turn'd once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,       The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall— Then sought thy straw in some sequester'd grange. But what—I dream! Two hundred years are flown Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,       And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe That thou wert wander'd from the studious walls       To learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe;            And thou from earth art gone Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid—       Some country-nook, where o'er thy unknown grave       Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave, Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree's shade. —No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours! For what wears out the life of mortal men?       'Tis that from change to change their being rolls; 'Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,       Exhaust the energy of strongest souls            And numb the elastic powers. Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,       And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,       To the just-pausing Genius we remit Our worn-out life, and are—what we have been. Thou hast not lived, why should'st thou perish, so? Thou hadst one aim, one business, one desire;       Else wert thou long since number'd with the dead! Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!       The generations of thy peers are fled,            And we ourselves shall go; But thou possessest an immortal lot,       And we imagine thee exempt from age       And living as thou liv'st on Glanvil's page, Because thou hadst—what we, alas! have not. For early didst thou leave the world, with powers Fresh, undiverted to the world without,       Firm to their mark, not spent on other things; Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,       Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings.            O life unlike to ours! Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,       Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,       And each half lives a hundred different lives; Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope. Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we, Light half-believers of our casual creeds,       Who never deeply felt, nor clearly will'd, Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,       Whose vague resolves never have been fulfill'd;            For whom each year we see Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;       Who hesitate and falter life away,       And lose to-morrow the ground won to-day— Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too? Yes, we await it!—but it still delays, And then we suffer! and amongst us one,       Who most has suffer'd, takes dejectedly His seat upon the intellectual throne;       And all his store of sad experience he            Lays bare of wretched days; Tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs,       And how the dying spark of hope was fed,       And how the breast was soothed, and how the head, And all his hourly varied anodynes. This for our wisest! and we others pine, And wish the long unhappy dream would end,       And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear; With close-lipp'd patience for our only friend,       Sad patience, too near neighbour to despair—            But none has hope like thine! Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,       Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,       Nursing thy project in unclouded joy, And every doubt long blown by time away. O born in days when wits were fresh and clear, And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;       Before this strange disease of modern life, With its sick hurry, its divided aims,       Its heads o'ertax'd, its palsied hearts, was rife—            Fly hence, our contact fear! Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!       Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern       From her false friend's approach in Hades turn, Wave us away, and keep thy solitude! Still nursing the unconquerable hope, Still clutching the inviolable shade,       With a free, onward impulse brushing through, By night, the silver'd branches of the glade—       Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,            On some mild pastoral slope Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales       Freshen thy flowers as in former years       With dew, or listen with enchanted ears, From the dark tingles, to the nightingales! But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly! For strong the infection of our mental strife,       Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest; And we should win thee from thy own fair life,       Like us distracted, and like us unblest.            Soon, soon thy cheer would die, Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix'd thy powers,       And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;       And then thy glad perennial youth would fade, Fade and grow old at last, and die like ours. Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles! —As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,       Descried at sunrise an emerging prow Lifting the cool-hair'd creepers stealthily,       The fringes of a southward-facing brow            Among the Ægæan Isles; And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,       Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,       Green, bursting figs, and tunnies steep'd in brine— And knew the intruders on his ancient home, The young light-hearted masters of the waves— And snatch'd his rudder, and shook out more sail;       And day and night held on indignantly O'er the blue Midland waters with the gale,       Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,            To where the Atlantic raves Outside the western straits; and unbent sails       There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,       Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come; And on the beach undid his corded bales.    "
"   How changed is here each spot man makes or fills!       In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the same;            The village street its haunted mansion lacks,       And from the sign is gone Sibylla's name,            And from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks—                 Are ye too changed, ye hills?       See, 'tis no foot of unfamiliar men            To-night from Oxford up your pathway strays!            Here came I often, often, in old days—       Thyrsis and I; we still had Thyrsis then. Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,       Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns            The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames?       The signal-elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs,            The Vale, the three lone weirs, the youthful Thames?—                 This winter-eve is warm,       Humid the air! leafless, yet soft as spring,            The tender purple spray on copse and briers!            And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,       She needs not June for beauty's heightening, Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!—       Only, methinks, some loss of habit's power            Befalls me wandering through this upland dim.       Once pass'd I blindfold here, at any hour;            Now seldom come I, since I came with him.                 That single elm-tree bright       Against the west—I miss it! is it goner?            We prized it dearly; while it stood, we said,            Our friend, the Gipsy-Scholar, was not dead;       While the tree lived, he in these fields lived on. Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here,       But once I knew each field, each flower, each stick;            And with the country-folk acquaintance made       By barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick.            Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assay'd.                 Ah me! this many a year       My pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday!            Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart            Into the world and wave of men depart;       But Thyrsis of his own will went away. It irk'd him to be here, he could not rest.       He loved each simple joy the country yields,            He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,       For that a shadow lour'd on the fields,            Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep.                 Some life of men unblest       He knew, which made him droop, and fill'd his head.            He went; his piping took a troubled sound            Of storms that rage outside our happy ground;       He could not wait their passing, he is dead. So, some tempestuous morn in early June,       When the year's primal burst of bloom is o'er,            Before the roses and the longest day—       When garden-walks and all the grassy floor            With blossoms red and white of fallen May                 And chestnut-flowers are strewn—       So have I heard the cuckoo's parting cry,            From the wet field, through the vext garden-trees,            Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze: The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I! Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?       Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come on,            Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,       Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,            Sweet-William with his homely cottage-smell,                 And stocks in fragrant blow;       Roses that down the alleys shine afar,            And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,            And groups under the dreaming garden-trees,       And the full moon, and the white evening-star. He hearkens not! light comer, he is flown!       What matters it? next year he will return,            And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days,       With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern,            And blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways,                 And scent of hay new-mown.       But Thyrsis never more we swains shall see;            See him come back, and cut a smoother reed,            And blow a strain the world at last shall heed—       For Time, not Corydon, hath conquer'd thee! Alack, for Corydon no rival now!—       But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate,            Some good survivor with his flute would go,       Piping a ditty sad for Bion's fate;            And cross the unpermitted ferry's flow,                 And relax Pluto's brow,       And make leap up with joy the beauteous head            Of Proserpine, among whose crowned hair            Are flowers first open'd on Sicilian air,       And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the dead. O easy access to the hearer's grace       When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!            For she herself had trod Sicilian fields,       She knew the Dorian water's gush divine,            She knew each lily white which Enna yields                 Each rose with blushing face;       She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain.            But ah, of our poor Thames she never heard!            Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirr'd;       And we should tease her with our plaint in vain!       Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be,            Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour            In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd hill!       Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?            I know the wood which hides the daffodil,                 I know the Fyfield tree,       I know what white, what purple fritillaries            The grassy harvest of the river-fields,            Above by Ensham, down by Sandford, yields,       And what sedged brooks are Thames's tributaries; I know these slopes; who knows them if not I?—       But many a tingle on the loved hillside,            With thorns once studded, old, white-blossom'd trees,       Where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried            High tower'd the spikes of purple orchises,                 Hath since our day put by       The coronals of that forgotten time;            Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy's team,            And only in the hidden brookside gleam       Primroses, orphans of the flowery prime. Where is the girl, who by the boatman's door,       Above the locks, above the boating throng,            Unmoor'd our skiff when through the Wytham flats,       Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among            And darting swallows and light water-gnats,                 We track'd the shy Thames shore?       Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell            Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass,            Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?—       They all are gone, and thou art gone as well! Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night       In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade.            I see her veil draw soft across the day,       I feel her slowly chilling breath invade            The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with grey;                 I feel her finger light       Laid pausefully upon life's headlong train; —            The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,            The heart less bounding at emotion new,       And hope, once crush'd, less quick to spring again. And long the way appears, which seem'd so short       To the less practised eye of sanguine youth;            And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air,       The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth,            Tops in life's morning-sun so bright and bare!                 Unbreachable the fort       Of the long-batter'd world uplifts its wall;            And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,            And near and real the charm of thy repose,       And night as welcome as a friend would fall. But hush! the upland hath a sudden loss       Of quiet!—Look, adown the dusk hill-side,            A troop of Oxford hunters going home,       As in old days, jovial and talking, ride!            From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they come.                 Quick! let me fly, and cross       Into yon farther field!—'Tis done; and see,            Back'd by the sunset, which doth glorify            The orange and pale violet evening-sky,       Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the Tree! I take the omen! Eve lets down her veil,       The white fog creeps from bush to bush about,            The west unflushes, the high stars grow bright,       And in the scatter'd farms the lights come out.            I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night,                 Yet, happy omen, hail!       Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale            (For there thine earth forgetting eyelids keep            The morningless and unawakening sleep       Under the flowery oleanders pale), Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!—       Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland dim,            These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,       That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him;            To a boon southern country he is fled,                 And now in happier air,       Wandering with the great Mother's train divine            (And purer or more subtle soul than thee,            I trow, the mighty Mother doth not see)       Within a folding of the Apennine, Thou hearest the immortal chants of old!—       Putting his sickle to the perilous grain            In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king,       For thee the Lityerses-song again            Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing;                 Sings his Sicilian fold,       His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes—            And how a call celestial round him rang,            And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang,       And all the marvel of the golden skies. There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here       Sole in these fields! yet will I not despair.            Despair I will not, while I yet descry       'Neath the mild canopy of English air            That lonely tree against the western sky.                 Still, still these slopes, 'tis clear,       Our Gipsy-Scholar haunts, outliving thee!            Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay,            Woods with anemonies in flower till May,       Know him a wanderer still; then why not me? A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,       Shy to illumine; and I seek it too.            This does not come with houses or with gold,       With place, with honour, and a flattering crew;            'Tis not in the world's market bought and sold—                 But the smooth-slipping weeks       Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;            Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,            He wends unfollow'd, he must house alone;       Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired. Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast bound;       Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour!            Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,       If men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee power,            If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest.                 And this rude Cumner ground,       Its fir-topped Hurst, its farms, its quiet fields,            Here cams't thou in thy jocund youthful time,            Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!       And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields. What though the music of thy rustic flute       Kept not for long its happy, country tone;            Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note       Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,            Which task'd thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat—                 It fail'd, and thou wage mute!       Yet hadst thou always visions of our light,            And long with men of care thou couldst not stay,            And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way,       Left human haunt, and on alone till night. Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!       'Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore,            Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home.       —Then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying roar,            Let in thy voice a whisper often come,                 To chase fatigue and fear: Why faintest thou! I wander'd till I died.  Roam on! The light we sought is shining still.  Dost thou ask proof? Our tree yet crowns the hill,  Our Scholar travels yet the loved hill-side.    "
"   Even in a palace, life may be led well! So spake the imperial sage, purest of men, Marcus Aurelius. But the stifling den Of common life, where, crowded up pell-mell, Our freedom for a little bread we sell, And drudge under some foolish master's ken Who rates us if we peer outside our pen— Match'd with a palace, is not this a hell? Even in a palace! On his truth sincere, Who spoke these words, no shadow ever came; And when my ill-school'd spirit is aflame Some nobler, ampler stage of life to win, I'll stop, and say: ""There were no succour here! The aids to noble life are all within.""    "
"   'Tis death! and peace, indeed, is here,And ease from shame, and rest from fear.There's nothing can dismarble nowThe smoothness of that limpid brow.But is a calm like this, in truth,The crowning end of life and youth,And when this boon rewards the dead,Are all debts paid, has all been said?And is the heart of youth so light,Its step so firm, its eye so bright,Because on its hot brow there blowsA wind of promise and reposeFrom the far grave, to which it goes;Because it hath the hope to come,One day, to harbour in the tomb?Ah no, the bliss youth dreams is oneFor daylight, for the cheerful sun,For feeling nerves and living breath—Youth dreams a bliss on this side death.It dreams a rest, if not more deep,More grateful than this marble sleep;It hears a voice within it tell:Calm's not life's crown, though calm is well.'Tis all perhaps which man acquires,But 'tis not what our youth desires.

"   I’ve known rivers:   I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.   My soul has grown deep like the rivers.   I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.   I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.   I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.   I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.   I’ve known rivers:   Ancient, dusky rivers.   My soul has grown deep like the rivers.   "
"   My shoulders ache beneath my pack (Lie easier, Cross, upon His back). I march with feet that burn and smart (Tread, Holy Feet, upon my heart). Men shout at me who may not speak (They scourged Thy back and smote Thy cheek). I may not lift a hand to clear My eyes of salty drops that sear. (Then shall my fickle soul forget Thy agony of Bloody Sweat?) My rifle hand is stiff and numb (From Thy pierced palm red rivers come). Lord, Thou didst suffer more for me Than all the hosts of land and sea. So let me render back again This millionth of Thy gift. Amen.    "
"   Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,   Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,   I heard a Negro play.   Down on Lenox Avenue the other night   By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light   He did a lazy sway. . . .   He did a lazy sway. . . .   To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.   With his ebony hands on each ivory key   He made that poor piano moan with melody.   O Blues!   Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool   He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.   Sweet Blues!   Coming from a black man’s soul.   O Blues!   In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone   I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—   “Ain’t got nobody in all this world,   Ain’t got nobody but ma self.   I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’   And put ma troubles on the shelf.”   Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.   He played a few chords then he sang some more—   “I got the Weary Blues   And I can’t be satisfied.   Got the Weary Blues   And can’t be satisfied—   I ain’t happy no mo’   And I wish that I had died.”   And far into the night he crooned that tune.   The stars went out and so did the moon.   The singer stopped playing and went to bed   While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.   He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.   "
"   My name is Johnson—   Madam Alberta K.   The Madam stands for business.      I’m smart that way.   I had a   HAIR-DRESSING PARLOR      Before   The depression put   The prices lower.   Then I had a   BARBECUE STAND      Till I got mixed up      With a no-good man.   Cause I had a insurance      The WPA   Said, We can’t use you      Wealthy that way.   I said,   DON’T WORRY ’BOUT ME!   Just like the song,   You WPA folks take care of yourself—   And I’ll get along.   I do cooking,   Day’s work, too!   Alberta K. Johnson—Madam to you.   "
"   I was so sick last night I   Didn’t hardly know my mind.   So sick last night I   Didn’t know my mind.   I drunk some bad licker that   Almost made me blind.   Had a dream last night I   Thought I was in hell.   I drempt last night I   Thought I was in hell.   Woke up and looked around me—   Babe, your mouth was open like a well.   I said, Baby! Baby!   Please don’t snore so loud.   Baby! Please!   Please don’t snore so loud.   You jest a little bit o’ woman but you   Sound like a great big crowd.   "
"   The instructor said,      Go home and write         a page tonight.         And let that page come out of you—         Then, it will be true."
"I dreamt of autumn in the window's twilight,  And you, a tipsy jesters' throng amidst. '  And like a falcon, having stooped to slaughter,  My heart returned to settle on your wrist.    But time went on, grew old and deaf. Like thawing  Soft ice old silk decayed on easy chairs.  A bloated sunset from the garden painted  The glass with bloody red September tears.    But time grew old and deaf. And you, the loud one,  Quite suddenly were still. This broke a spell.  The dreaming ceased at once, as though in answer  To an abruptly silenced bell.    And I awakened. Dismal as the autumn  The dawn was dark. A stronger wind arose  To chase the racing birchtrees on the skyline,  As from a running cart the streams of straws."
"Ah, how I love it in these first few days,  Fresh from the forest and out of the snow,  Awkwardness obvious still in every bough,  When every silver thread lazily sways  And every cone begins slowly to glow  In candlelightâ€”and the white sheet below  Hides its sore stump from our eyes.    It will not bat an eye if you heap gold  And jewels on it-this shyest of fays  In blue enamel and tinfoil enfolded  Creeps in your heart of heartsâ€”and there it stays.  Ah, how I love it all in these first days,  All golden finery and silver shades!    All in the making-stars, flags, lanterns, flares,  There are no chocolates yet in bonbonnieres.  Even the candles are no candlesâ€”they  Look more like dull sticks of makeup by day.  This is an actress still lighting stage fright  In the tumult of her benefit night.  Ah, how I love her on this opening day,  Flushed in the coulisses before the play!    Apples to appletrees, and kicks to firtrees.  Only not this oneâ€”no kicks for the beauty.  She has a different purpose and duty.  She's the select one, receiver of favours.  Her evening party will go on forever.  Others may fear proverb s-this one does not.    Her fate is only a few firtrees' lot.  Golden and fiery, she will soar high,  Like an old prophet ascending the sky.    Ah, how I love it all in these first days,  When all the world chats and fusses and plays!"
"The air is full of after-thunder freshness,  And everything rejoices and revives.  With the whole outburst of its purple clusters  The lilac drinks the air of paradise.    The gutters overflow; the change of weather  Makes all you see appear alive and new.  Meanwhile the shades of sky are growing lighter,  Beyond the blackest cloud the height is blue.    An artist's hand, with mastery still greater  Wipes dirt and dust off objects in his path.  Reality and life, the past and present,  Emerge transformed out of his colour-bath.    The memory of over half a lifetime  Like swiftly passing thunder dies away.  The century is no more under wardship:  High time to let the future have its say.    It is not revolutions and upheavals  That clear the road to new and better days,  But revelations, lavishness and torments  Of someone's soul, inspired and ablaze."
"The morning sun shows like a pillar  Of fire through smoke on frosty days.  As on a faulty snap, it cannot  Make out my features in the haze.    The distant trees will hardly see me  Until the sun at last can break  Out of the fog, and flash triumphant  Upon the meadows by the lake.    A passer-by in mist receding  Is recognized when he has passed.  You walk on hoarfrost-covered pathways  As though on mats of plaited bast.    The frost is covered up in gooseflesh,  The air is false like painted cheeks,  The earth is shivering, and sick of  Breathing potato-stalks for weeks."
"To give this book a dedication  The desert sickened,  And lions roared, and dawns of tigers  Took hold of Kipling.    A dried-up well of dreadful longing  Was gaping, yawning.  They swayed and shivered, rubbing shoulders,  Sleek-skinned and tawny.    Since then continuing forever  Their sway in scansion,  They stroll in mist through dewy meadows  Dreamt up by Ganges.    Creeping at dawn in pits and hollows  Cold sunrays fumble.  Funereal, incense-laden dampness  Pervades the jungle."
"Black spring! Pick up your pen, and weeping,  Of February, in sobs and ink,  Write poems, while the slush in thunder  Is burning in the black of spring.    Through clanking wheels, through church bells ringing  A hired cab will take you where  The town has ended, where the showers  Are louder still than ink and tears.    Where rooks, like charred pears, from the branches  In thousands break away, and sweep  Into the melting snow, instilling  Dry sadness into eyes that weep.    Beneath - the earth is black in puddles,  The wind with croaking screeches throbs,  And-the more randomly, the surer  Poems are forming out of sobs.  "
"It snowed and snowed ,the whole world over,  Snow swept the world from end to end.  A candle burned on the table;  A candle burned.    As during summer midges swarm  To beat their wings against a flame  Out in the yard the snowflakes swarmed  To beat against the window pane    The blizzard sculptured on the glass  Designs of arrows and of whorls.  A candle burned on the table;  A candle burned.    Distorted shadows fell  Upon the lighted ceiling:  Shadows of crossed arms,of crossed legs-  Of crossed destiny.    Two tiny shoes fell to the floor  And thudded.  A candle on a nightstand shed wax tears  Upon a dress.    All things vanished within  The snowy murk-white,hoary.  A candle burned on the table;  A candle burned.    A corner draft fluttered the flame  And the white fever of temptation  Upswept its angel wings that cast  A cruciform shadow    It snowed hard throughout the month  Of February, and almost constantly  A candle burned on the table;  A candle burned."
"The sun is hotter than the top ledge in a steam bath;  The ravine, crazed, is rampaging below.  Spring -- that corn-fed, husky milkmaid --  Is busy at her chores with never a letup.    The snow is wasting (pernicious anemia --  See those branching veinlets of impotent blue?)  Yet in the cowbarn life is burbling, steaming,  And the tines of pitchforks simply glow with health.    These days -- these days, and these nights also!  With eavesdrop thrumming its tattoos at noon,  With icicles (cachectic!) hanging on to gables,  And with the chattering of rills that never sleep!    All doors are flung open -- in stable and in cowbarn;  Pigeons peck at oats fallen in the snow;  And the culprit of all this and its life-begetter--  The pile of manure -- is pungent with ozone.  "
"I used to glorify the poor,  Not simply lofty views expressing:  Their lives alone, I felt, were true,  Devoid of pomp and window-dressing.    No stranger to the manor house,  Its finery and lordly tenor,  I was a friend of down-and-outs,  And shunned the idly sponging manner.    For choosing friendship in the ranks  Of working people, though no rebel,  I had the honour to be stamped  As also one among the rabble.    The state of basements, unadorned,  Of attics with no frills or curtains  Was tangible without pretence  And full of substance, weighty, certain.    And I went bad when rot defaced  Our time, and life became infested,  When grief was censured as disgrace  And all played optimists and yes-men.    My faith in those who seemed my friends  Was broken and our ties were sundered.  I, too, lost Man, the Human, since  He had been lost by all and sundry."
"When, having finished, I shall move my armchair,  The page will gasp, awakened from the strain.  Delirious, she is half asleep at present,  Obedient to suspense and to the rain.    The heaviness of burnt-out ships has numbed her,  Prostrated, weighted down her senseless form;  You cannot dupe this one by false pretences-  It is the poet who will keep her warm.    I told her at an hour (its secret shudder  Vouchsafed by fancy) when the winter will  Light up green screeching ice, fed up with waiting  Behind an office worker's window sill,    And clocks in banks and other public places,  While drinking in the snow and outside's dark,  Will suddenly jump up and strike-their faces  Crossed by the clockhands at the ""seven"" mark-    At such a deep, at such a fateful hour,  I made the page wake up and take her chance,  To put on hood and scarf, and venture out to  Descendants, strangers, shaking off her trance."
"Do not fret, do not cry, do not tax  Your last strength, and your heart do not torture.  You're alive, you're inside me, intact,  As a buttress, a friend, an adventure.    I've no fear of standing exposed  As a fraud in my faith in the future.  It's not life, not a union of souls  We are breaking off, but a hoax mutual.    From straw mattresses' sick wretchedness  To the fresh air of wide open spaces!  It's my brother and hand. It's addressed  Like a letter, to you, crisp and bracing.    Like an envelope, tear it across,  With Horizon begin correspondence,  Give your speech the sheer Alpian force,  Overcome the sick sense of forlornness.    O'er the bowl of Bavarian lakes  With the marrow of osseous mountains  You will know I was not a glib fake  And of sugared assurances spouter.    Fare ye well and God bless you! Our bond  And our honour aren't tamely domestic.  Like a sprout in the sunlight, unbend,  And then things will assume a new aspect.    NEXT POEM "
"From early morning-nonsense  With tubs and troughs and strain,  With dampness in the evening  And sunsets in the rain.    Deep sighing of the darkness  And choking swallowed tears,  A railway engine's calling  Down from the sixteenth verst.    Outside and in the garden  A short fast-darkening day;  Small breakages and losses  In true September way.    In daytime autumn's vastness  Beyond the stream is rent  By wailing in the graveyard,  By anguish and lament.    But when the widow's sobbing  Is carried from the bank,  With all my blood I'm with her  And see my death point-blank.    As every year I see it  Out of the hall downstairs,  The long-delayed approaching  Of this my final year.    Through leaves in yellow terror,  Its way swept clear, I see  That winter from the hillside  Is staring down at me."
"Outside the snowstorm spins, and hides  The world beneath a pall.  Snowed under are the paper-girl,  The papers and the stall.    Quite often our experience  Has led us to believe  That snow falls out of reticence,  In order to deceive.    Concealing unrepentantly  And trimming you in white,  How often he has brought you home  Into the town at night!    While snowflakes blind and blanket out  The distance more and more,  A tipsy shadow gropes his way  And staggers to the door.    And then he enters hastily...  Again, for all I know,  Someone has something sinful to  Conceal in all this snow!"
"Here will be echoes in the mountains,  The distant landslides' rumbling boom,  The rocks, the dwellings in the village,  The sorry little inn, the gloom    Of something black beyond the Terek,  Clouds moving heavily. Up there  The day was breaking very slowly;  It dawned, but light was nowhere near.    One sensed the heaviness of darkness  For miles ahead around Kazbek  Wound on the heights: though some were trying  To throw the halter from their neck.    As if cemented in an oven,  In the strange substance of a dream,  A pot of poisoned food, the region  Of Daghestan there slowly steamed.    Its towering peaks towards us rolling,  All black from top to foot, it strained  To meet our car, if not with clashing  Of daggers, then with pouring rain.    The mountains were preparing trouble.  The handsome giants, fierce and black,  Each one more evil than the other  Were closing down upon our track.    NEXT POEM "
"Be pleased if the wind that enters the orchard  brings back the surge of life:  here where a dead tangle of memories  sinks and founders,  there was no garden, only a reliquary.    The flapping you hear is not flight  but a commotion in the eternal womb;  you see how this strip of solitary earth  transforms itself into a crucible.    Beyond the sheer wall is rage.  If you proceed, you might bump intoâ€”  perhaps you mightâ€”the saving apparition:  here the stories are composed, the acts  that the game of the future will cancel.    Look for a broken link in the net  that holds us down, jump out and flee!  Go, I've prayed this for youâ€”now my thirst  will be lighter; the rust less bitter. . .  "
"Again and again I have seen life's evil:  it was the strangled brook, still gurgling,  it was the curling of the shriveled leaf,  it was the fallen horse.    I have known no good except the miracle  that reveals the divine Indifference:  it was the statue in the drowsy trance  of noon, the cloud, the cruising falcon."
"To spend the afternoon, absorbed and pale,  beside a burning garden wall;  to hear, among the stubble and the thorns,  the blackbirds cackling and the rustling snakes.    On the cracked earth or in the vetch  to spy on columns of red ants  now crossing, now dispersing,  atop their miniature heaps.    To ponder, peering through the leaves,  the heaving of the scaly sea  while the cicadas' wavering screech  goes up from balding peaks.    And walking out into the sunlight's glare  to feel with melancholy wonder  how all of life and its travail  is in this following a wall  topped with the shards of broken bottles."
"Glory of expanded noon  when the trees give up no shade,  and more and more the look of things  is turning bronze, from excess light.    Above, the sunâ€”and a dry shore;  so my day is not yet done:  the finest hour is over the low wall,  closed off by a pale setting sun.    Drought all around: kingfisher hovers  over something life has left.  The good rain is beyond the barrenness,  but there's greater joy in waiting."
"To lie in shadow on the lawn  By a crumbling wall, pale and withdrawn  And spy in the weeds the gliding snake  And hear the rustle blackbirds make â€“    To watch in the cracked earth and the grass  Battalions of red ants at drill,  That break and form ranks, pass and repass  In busy marches on some tiny hill â€“    To catch, each time the leaves blow free,  The faint and pulsing motion of the sea,  While ceaseless, tremulous and shrill,  The cicadas chatter on the bald hill â€“    Rising, to wander in bewilderment  With the sun ' s dazzle, and the sorry thought  How all our life, and all its labors spent,  Are like a man upon a journey sent  Along a wall that ' s sheer and steep and  endless, dressed  With bits of broken bottles on its crest."
"Bring me the sunflower so I can transplant it  here in my own field burned by salt-spray,  so it can show all day to the blue reflection of the sky  the anxiety of its golden face.    Darker things yearn for a clarity,  bodies fade and exhaust themselves in a flood  of colors, as colors do in music. To vanish,  therefore, is the best of all good luck.    Bring me the plant that leads us  where blond transparencies rise up  and life evaporates like an essence;  bring me the sunflower sent mad with light"
"  The sea that breaks on the opposite shore  throws up a cloud that spumes  until the sand flats reabsorb it. There,  one day, we jettisoned, on the iron coast,  our hope, more gasping than  the open seaâ€”and the fertile abyss turns green  as in the days that saw us among the living.    Now that the north wind has flattened out the cloudy tangle  of gravy-colored currents and headed them back  to where they started, all around someone has hung  on the limbs of the tree thicket fish nets that string  along the path that goes down  out of sight;  faded nets that. dry in the late  and cold touch of the light; and over them  the thick blue crystal of the sky winks  and slides toward a wave-lashed arc  of horizon.    More than seawrack dragged  from the seething that uncovers us, our life  moves against such stasis: and still it seethes  in us, that one thing which one day stopped, resigned  to its limits; among the strands that bind  one branch to another, the heart struggles  like a young marsh hen  caught in the net's meshes;  and motionless and migratory it holds us,  an icy steadfastness.  Thus  maybe the dead too have an rest taken away from them  in the ground; a force more pitiless  than life itself pulls them away from there, and all around  (shadows gnawed and swallowed by human memories)  drives them to these shores, breaths  without body or voice  betrayed by the darkness;  and their thwarted flights brush by us even now,  so recently separated from us, so close still,  and back in the sea's sieve go down..."
"The storm that trickles its long March  thunderclaps, its hail, onto the stiff  leaves of the magnolia tree;  (sounds of shaking crystal which startle you  in your nest of sleep; and the gold  snuffed on the mahogany, on the backs  of the bound books, flares again  like a grain of sugar in the shell  of your eyelids)    the lightning that blanches  the trees and walls, freezing them  like images on a negative (a benediction  and destruction you carry carved  within you, a condemnation that binds you  stronger to me than any love, my strange sister):  and then the tearing crash, the jangling sistrums, the rustle  of tambourines in the dark ditch of the night,  the tramp, scrape, jump of the fandango. . .and overhead  some gesture that blindly is groping. . .  as when  turning around, and, sweeping clear your forehead  of its cloud of hair,  you waved to meâ€”and entered the dark.  "
"Hear me a moment. Laureate poets  seem to wander among plants  no one knows: boxwood, acanthus,  where nothing is alive to touch.  I prefer small streets that falter  into grassy ditches where a boy,  searching in the sinking puddles,  might capture a struggling eel.  The little path that winds down  along the slope plunges through cane-tufts  and opens suddenly into the orchard  among the moss-green trunks  of the lemon trees.    Perhaps it is better  if the jubilee of small birds  dies down, swallowed in the sky,  yet more real to one who listens,  the murmur of tender leaves  in a breathless, unmoving air.  The senses are graced with an odor  filled with the earth.  It is like rain in a troubled breast,  sweet as an air that arrives  too suddenly and vanishes.  A miracle is hushed; all passions  are swept aside. Even the poor  know that richness,  the fragrance of the lemon trees.    You realize that in silences  things yield and almost betray  their ultimate secrets.  At times, one half expects  to discover an error in Nature,  the still point of reality,  the missing link that will not hold,  the thread we cannot untangle  in order to get at the truth.    You look around. Your mind seeks,  makes harmonies, falls apart  in the perfume, expands  when the day wearies away.  There are silences in which one watches  in every fading human shadow  something divine let go.    The illusion wanes, and in time we return  to our noisy cities where the blue  appears only in fragments  high up among the towering shapes.  Then rain leaching the earth.  Tedious, winter burdens the roofs,  and light is a miser, the soul bitter.  Yet, one day through an open gate,  among the green luxuriance of a yard,  the yellow lemons fire  and the heart melts,  and golden songs pour  into the breast  from the raised cornets of the sun."
"Do not ask us for the word that gives shape from all angles  to our formless soul, and in letters of fire  declares it, and shines forth like a crocus,  lost in the middle of a dusty field.    Ah, the man who goes on confidently,  to others and to himself a friend,  unfazed by his own shadow which the Dog Star  stamps over a decrepit wall!    Do not demand from us the formula unfolding worlds before you,  rather a few crooked syllables - and dry like a twig.    That alone today we can tell you,  who we are not, what we do not want."
"The shadow of the Japanese magnolia    has thinned now the purple flowers    are fallen. At its top, a cicada    vibrates intermittently. It is no longer    the time of voices in unison,    Clizia, the time of the infinite deity,    who devours his faithful, revives them with blood.    To expend oneself was easier, to die    at the first wing-beat, the first encounter    with the enemy, a plaything. No a harder    path begins; but not for you,    consumed by sunlight, rooted, and yet a soft    thrush that flies high over your cold    river-banks â€“ not for you fragile    fugitive for whom zenith nadir Cancer    Capricorn remained indistinct    because the war could have been in you and who adores    in you the stigmata of your Spouse, the shudder    of ice bendsâ€¦the others retreat    and bow. The file that pares    thinly will fall silent. The empty husk    of those who sang will soon be glass    dust under your feet, the shadow is livid â€“    it ' s autumn, it ' s winter, it ' s the other side of the sky    that accompanies you, into which I hurl myself, a mullet    leaping high and dry in the new moon.    Farewell."
"I recall your smile, and for me it is limpid water    witnessed by chance among the stones of a riverbed.    slight mirror in which you see an ivy and its inflorescence,    and over all the embrace of a serene white sky.    This is my recollection; I cannot say, O distant one,    if an ingenuous spirit is freely expressed in your face,    truly you are a wanderer whom the world ' s ills exhaust,    and who carry your suffering with you like a talisman.    But this I may say; that your thoughtful portrait    drowns anxious inspiration in a wave of calm;    and your aspect insinuates itself in grey memory    pure as the crown of a youthful palm-treeâ€¦"
"To rest in the shade, pale and thoughtful,    by a sun-hot garden wall    listening among thorns and brushwood    to the cry of blackbirds, the hiss of snakes.    In cracks in the soil or amongst the vetch    to spy on the files of red ants    now scattering now intertwining    at the top of miniscule mountains.    To observe among the leaves the distant    quivering scales of the sea,    while the tremulous cries rise    from cicadas on the naked hills.    And walking in the dazzling sun    to feel with a saddened wonder    how all of life and its travails    is in this following a wall    topped by bright shards of glass."
"The white cloud of maddened moths swirls    thickly round the pale lamps and over the parapets,    spreading a sheet on the ground that crackles    like sugar underfoot; now imminent summer liberates    the ice of night trapped    in the secret caves of the dead season,    in the gardens that stretch from Maiano here to Arno ' s shores.    Lately, on the Corso, an infernal messenger passed in flight    through cheering admirers; a mystic gulf, open    and decked with crosses, took and swallowed the bait;    the shops are shuttered, poor    and harmless though even those are armed    with cannon and toys of war,    the butcher has locked his grille, who wreathed    the heads of dead goats with berries,    the ritual of mild executioners who still do not realise blood    has been transmuted into the foul tangle of crushed wings    of insects on the embankments, and water continues    to gnaw the banks, and no one is innocent.    All for nothing then? â€“ And the Roman candles,    on Saint John ' s Day, that slowly bleached    the horizon, and the pledges and long goodbyes    intense as a baptism in gloomy expectation    of the horde (yet a comet scored the dripping air    on the ice and shores of your coasts,    the angels Tobias saw, the seven, the future    arriving) and the sunflower born    from your hands â€“ all burned and desiccated    in this pollen that shrills like fire    with the sharpness of icy sleetâ€¦    Oh, the wounded    spring is still festive though frozen    in death, this death! Your fate, Clizia,    is still cherished above, you    who preserve a love unaltered though altered    pure in what the blind sun might bring you,    dazed by the Highest, and destroyed    in Him, for all. Perhaps the sirens, the tolling bells,    that greeted the monsters in their stormy    evening are already confounded    with a sound loosed from heaven, descending, in victory â€“    with the breath of a dawn that rises tomorrow    for all, white but without those dreadful    wings, over the scorched shores of the southâ€¦"
"Evil I ' ve often encountered in life;    it was the strangled rivulet gurgling,    it was the shrivelling of parched    leaves, it was the horse falling heavily.    Good I have not known; except the wonder    that reveals divine Indifference;    it was the statue in the somnolence    of noon, and the cloud, and the hawk flying high.    "
"The hope even of seeing you again    has left me;    and I wondered if what robs me    of all sense of you, screen of images,    reveals the signs of death or is    essentially the past, but distorted, rendered labile,    a bedazzlement of yours;    (at Modena, among the colonnades,    a liveried servant led    two jackals on a leash)    "
"Happiness is achieved for you, walking    thus, on the edge of a knife blade.    To our eyes you are a wavering gleam,    afoot, tense ice that fractures;    so who loves you most cannot touch you.    If you come upon spirits invaded    with sadness and brighten them, your morning    is sweet and troubled like the nests on high.    But nothing compensates for the cry of the child    whose ball is in flight among the houses."
"I free your brow of all the ice    you have gathered traversing the high    clouds; your feathers lacerated    by cyclones, you woke to lightning jolts.    Noon: the medlar in the square extends    its dark shadow, a cold sun hangs    in the sky; and the other shadows lurking    in the alley do not know you are here."
"Even a flying feather can sketch    your figure, or a ray of light playing hide and seek    among tables and chairs, the signal    from a child ' s mirror, or the rooftops. Round the circuit    of walls trails of mist lengthen the spires    of the poplars, and down below on its perch    the knife-grinder ' s parrot ruffles its plumage. Then    sultry night in the little squares, footsteps, and always    the toilsome effort to sink so as to rise again equal    to centuries, moments, to nightmares that cannot    recover the light of your eyes in the incandescent    cave â€“ and still the same cries and the endless    plaint on the veranda,    if the sudden blow falls that reddens    your throat and breaks your wings, O perilous    herald of dawn,    and the cloisters and hospitals wake    to a laceration of trumpetsâ€¦"
"The journey ends here:    in the petty cares that divide    the spirit that no longer utters a cry.    Now the minutes are equal and fixed    like the rhythm of the pump ' s wheel.    A rotation: a spouting of rumbling water.    Another: more water, sometimes a creak.    The journey ends on this beach    that slow regular tides attempt.    The sea reveals nothing but idle vapours    the vigorous murmurs of shells    conceive; and rarely among the tranquil    mutations of islands of migrating air    Corsica ' s ridge or Capri appears.    You ask if all things vanish    in this little mist of memories;    if in this torpid hour, or in the sigh    of breakers every destiny completes.    I would say to you, no; the hour    approaches when you will pass beyond time;    perhaps only those who so wish become infinite,    and you may do so, who knows, not I.    I think for most it may be no salvation,    but some subvert every design,    make every crossing, discover what they desire.    First I would grant your crossing yourself,    that way of escape    uncertain as foam or a wrinkle    in the risen fields of the sea.    I grant you my miserly hope as well.    At daylight, weary, I cannot increase it:    my offer as pledge of the fate you evade.    The path ends with the brave    whom the tide gnaws with its ebb and flow.    Your heart close to me that hears me not    already sets sail perhaps for eternity.    "
