Poem
"   I slid the white louvers shut so I could stand in your closet a little while among the throng of flowered dresses you hadn’t worn in years, and touch the creases on each of their sleeves that smelled of forgivenessand even though you would still be alive a few more days I knew they were ready to let themselves be packed into liquor store boxes simply because you had asked that of them,and dropped at the door of the Salvation Army without having noticed me wrapping my arms around so many at once that one slipped a big padded shoulder off of its hanger as if to return the embrace.   "
"               Three summers since I chose a maid,        Too young maybe—but more’s to do        At harvest-time than bide and woo.                 When us was wed she turned afraid        Of love and me and all things human;        Like the shut of a winter’s day        Her smile went out, and ’twadn’t a woman—               More like a little frightened fay.                       One night, in the Fall, she runned away.            “Out ’mong the sheep, her be,” they said,        ’Should properly have been abed;        But sure enough she wadn’t there        Lying awake with her wide brown stare.   So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down        We chased her, flying like a hare        Before out lanterns. To Church-Town                 All in a shiver and a scare        We caught her, fetched her home at last                 And turned the key upon her, fast.            She does the work about the house        As well as most, but like a mouse:                 Happy enough to chat and play                 With birds and rabbits and such as they,                 So long as men-folk keep away.        “Not near, not near!” her eyes beseech        When one of us comes within reach.                 The women say that beasts in stall                 Look round like children at her call.                 I’ve hardly heard her speak at all.            Shy as a leveret, swift as he,        Straight and slight as a young larch tree,        Sweet as the first wild violets, she,        To her wild self. But what to me?            The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,                 The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,        One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,                 A magpie’s spotted feathers lie        On the black earth spread white with rime,        The berries redden up to Christmas-time.                 What’s Christmas-time without there be                 Some other in the house than we!                     She sleeps up in the attic there                 Alone, poor maid. ’Tis but a stair        Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,        The soft young down of her, the brown,   The brown of her—her eyes, her hair, her hair!   "
"   Bury your heart in some deep green hollow        Or hide it up in a kind old tree;   Better still, give it the swallow        When she goes over the sea.       In Saturday’s Market there’s eggs a ’plenty        And dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down,   Grey old gaffers and boys of twenty—        Girls and the women of the town—   Pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces,        Poises and whips and dicky-birds’ seed,   Silver pieces and smiling faces,        In Saturday Market they’ve all they need.       What were you showing in Saturday Market        That set it grinning from end to end   Girls and gaffers and boys of twenty—?        Cover it close with your shawl, my friend—   Hasten you home with the laugh behind you,        Over the down—, out of sight,   Fasten your door, though no one will find you,        No one will look on a Market night.       See, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under        The red dead thing—. In the white of the moon   On the flags does it stir again? Well, and no wonder!        Best make an end of it; bury it soon.   If there is blood on the hearth who’ll know it?        Or blood on the stairs,   When a murder is over and done why show it?        In Saturday Market nobody cares.            Then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping        And still, for a long, long rest,   There’s never a one in the town so sure of sleeping        As you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.                     Think no more of the swallow,                        Forget, you, the sea,        Never again remember the deep green hollow                        Or the top of the kind old tree!   "
"   I remember rooms that have had their part        In the steady slowing down of the heart.   The room in Paris, the room at Geneva,   The little damp room with the seaweed smell,   And that ceaseless maddening sound of the tide—        Rooms where for good or for ill—things died.   But there is the room where we (two) lie dead,   Though every morning we seem to wake and might just as well seem to sleep again        As we shall somewhere in the other quieter, dustier bed        Out there in the sun—in the rain.   "
"                     Up here, with June, the sycamore throws                         Across the window a whispering screen;           I shall miss the sycamore more, I suppose,   Than anything else on this earth that is out in green.                But I mean to go through the door without fear,                Not caring much what happens here                              When I’m away:—   How green the screen is across the panes                 Or who goes laughing along the lanes        With my old lover all summer day.    "
"   Not for that city of the level sun,        Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze—        The shadeless, sleepless city of white days,   White nights, or nights and days that are as one—   We weary, when all is said , all thought, all done.        We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see        What, from the threshold of eternity   We shall step into. No, I think we shun   The splendour of that everlasting glare,      The clamour of that never-ending song.      And if for anything we greatly long,   It is for some remote and quiet stair        Which winds to silence and a space for sleep        Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep.   "
"   Sweetheart, for such a day        One mustn’t grudge the score;   Here, then, it’s all to pay,        It’s Good-night at the door.       Good-night and good dreams to you,—        Do you remember the picture-book thieves   Who left two children sleeping in a wood the long night through,        And how the birds came down and covered them with leaves?       So you and I should have slept,—But now,        Oh, what a lonely head!   With just the shadow of a waving bough        In the moonlight over your bed.   "
"   Here, in the darkness, where this plaster saint          Stands nearer than God stands to our distress,   And one small candle shines, but not so faint        As the far lights of everlastingness,   I’d rather kneel than over there, in open day        Where Christ is hanging, rather pray            To something more like my own clay,                        Not too divine;            For, once, perhaps my little saint            Before he got his niche and crown,        Had one short stroll about the town;        It brings him closer, just that taint—               And anyone can wash the paint        Off our poor faces, his and mine!     Is that why I see Monty now? equal to any saint, poor boy, as good as gold,   But still, with just the proper trace   Of earthliness on his shining wedding face;   And then gone suddenly blank and old   The hateful day of the divorce:   Stuart got his, hands down, of course   Crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse:   But Monty took it hard. All said and done I liked him best,—   He was the first, he stands out clearer than the rest.                                It seems too funny all we other rips          Should have immortal souls; Monty and Redge quite damnably          Keep theirs afloat while we go down like scuttled ships.—                               It’s funny too, how easily we sink,                               One might put up a monument, I think                  To half the world and cut across it “Lost at Sea!”   I should drown Jim, poor little sparrow, if I netted him to-night—                            No, it’s no use this penny light—                   Or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown—                   The trees of Calvary are where they were,                          When we are sure that we can spare                      The tallest, let us go and strike it down                   And leave the other two still standing there.                                            I, too, would ask Him to remember me            If there were any Paradise beyond this earth that I could see.                                                          Oh! quiet Christ who never knew                        The poisonous fangs that bite us through                                 And make us do the things we do,                        See how we suffer and fight and die,                                 How helpless and how low we lie,                        God holds You, and You hang so high,                        Though no one looking long at You,                                 Can think You do not suffer too,   But, up there, from your still, star-lighted tree           What can You know, what can You really see                   Of this dark ditch, the soul of me!                       We are what we are: when I was half a child I could not sit   Watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning in the sun,                                                      Without paying so heavily for it                   That joy and pain, like any mother and her unborn child were almost one.                                                            I could hardly bear                                    The dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in the dusk,                                                    The thick, close voice of musk,                                           The jessamine music on the thin night air,                                     Or, sometimes, my own hands about me anywhere —      The sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent of my own hair,               Oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to the high seat                        Of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat      My soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street.                                               I think my body was my soul,                                              And when we are made thus                                                      Who shall control                              Our hands, our eyes, the wandering passion of our feet,                                              Who shall teach us      To thrust the world out of our heart: to say, till perhaps in death,                                                     When the race is run,              And it is forced from us with our last breath                                                     “Thy will be done”?   If it is Your will that we should be content with the tame, bloodless things.                   As pale as angels smirking by, with folded wings—                           Oh! I know Virtue, and the peace it brings!                                                      The temperate, well-worn smile                   The one man gives you, when you are evermore his own:                       And afterwards the child’s, for a little while,                                                    With its unknowing and all-seeing eyes             So soon to change, and make you feel how quick          The clock goes round. If one had learned the trick—                                                               (How does one though?) quite early on,                             Of long green pastures under placid skies,                             One might be walking now with patient truth.             What did we ever care for it, who have asked for youth,                             When, oh! my God! this is going or has gone?                                     There is a portrait of my mother, at nineteen,                        With the black spaniel, standing by the garden seat,                        The dainty head held high against the painted green   And throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty and half sweet.                        Her picture then: but simply Youth, or simply Spring                                     To me to-day: a radiance on the wall,                                     So exquisite, so heart-breaking a thing                        Beside the mask that I remember, shrunk and small,                                        Sapless and lined like a dead leaf,   All that was left of oh! the loveliest face, by time and grief!           And in the glass, last night, I saw a ghost behind my chair—       Yet why remember it, when one can still go moderately gay—?                   Or could—with any one of the old crew,                           But oh! these boys! the solemn way                   They take you and the things they say—                   This “I have only as long as you”       When you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two—                   Although at heart perhaps—God! if it were                                   Only the face, only the hair!                           If Jim had written to me as he did to-day                           A year ago—and now it leaves me cold—                                    I know what this means, old, old, old:                         Et avec ça—mais on a vécu, tout se paie.        That is not always true: there was my Mother (well at least the dead are free!)                    Yoked to the man that Father was; yoked to the woman I am, Monty too;                   The little portress at the Convent School, stewing in hell so patiently;   The poor, fair boy who shot himself at Aix. And what of me—and what of me ?                   But I, I paid for what I had, and they for nothing. No, one cannot see                              How it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity.   If there were fifty heavens God could not give us back the child who went or never came;                    Here, on our little patch of this great earth, the sun of any darkened day.                 Not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of last year’s May,                                 No shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday;                    For every hour they slant across the hedge a different way,                                    The shadows are never the same.                            “Find rest in Him” One knows the parsons’ tags—                    Back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock of baa-ing sheep:   Yes, it may be, when He has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the bleating soul in us to rags,                                    For so He giveth His belovèd sleep.                                Oh! He will take us stripped and done,                                Driven into His heart. So we are won:                     Then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of His everlasting wings—                     I do not envy Him his victories, His arms are full of broken things.                                But I shall not be in them. Let Him take                                    The finer ones, the easier to break.   And they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours, the perfumes,                            Though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms.                                             In silks and in gemlike wines;                     Here, even, in this corner where my little candle shines                                             And overhead the lancet-window glows                            With golds and crimsons you could almost drink    To know how jewels taste, just as I used to think   There was the scent in every red and yellow rose                                   Of all the sunsets. But this place is grey,                                          And much too quiet. No one here,                                          Why, this is awful, this is fear!                                                     Nothing to see, no face.                            Nothing to hear except your heart beating in space                                           As if the world was ended. Dead at last!                                           Dead soul, dead body, tied together fast.                            These to go on with and alone, to the slow end:                    No one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend:                            Out of the long procession, black or white or red   Not one left now to say “Still I am here, then see you, dear, lay here your head”.                            Only the doll’s house looking on the Park                    To-night, all nights, I know, when the man puts the lights out, very dark.   With, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids' footsteps overhead,   Then utter silence and the empty world—the room—the bed—                                            The corpse! No, not quite dead, while this cries out in me.                                                             But nearly: very soon to be                                                             A handful of forgotten dust—                                           There must be someone. Christ! there must,                                                Tell me there will be someone. Who?                                           If there were no one else, could it be You?                                               How old was Mary out of whom you cast                    So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years   She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past                    Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon’s house                                           And stood and looked at You through tears.                                                        I think she must have known by those                                           The thing, for what it was that had come to her.                                           For some of us there is a passion, I suppose,                                           So far from earthly cares and earthly fears                                           That in its stillness you can hardly stir                                                        Or in its nearness, lift your hand,                                           So great that you have simply got to stand                                           Looking at it through tears, through tears.                                           Then straight from these there broke the kiss,                                                       I think You must have known by this                                           The thing, for what it was, that had come to You:                                                       She did not love You like the rest,                                            It was in her own way, but at the worst, the best,                                                       She gave You something altogether new.                                            And through it all, from her, no word,                                                       She scarcely saw You, scarcely heard:                                            Surely You knew when she so touched You with her hair,                                                       Or by the wet cheek lying there,   And while her perfume clung to You from head to feet all through the day                                            That You can change the things for which we care,                                            But even You, unless You kill us, not the way.                                                This, then was peace for her, but passion too.                                                    I wonder was it like a kiss that once I knew,                                                 The only one that I would care to take          Into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards, to wake.                                                 Almost as happy as the carven dead                                            In some dim chancel lying head by head          We slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through—   One breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our lips was endless life,          Lost, as I woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his “Are you there?”                                      And lie still, listening to the wind outside, among the firs.              So Mary chose the dream of Him for what was left to her of night and day,   It is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other                                  thing can take away:          But if she had not touched Him in the doorway of the dream could she have                                  cared so much ?          She was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards, but first the touch.       And He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees   Of Eden and Calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears,   And the happier guests who would not see, or if they did, remember these,                                                         Though they lived there a thousand years.                                          Outside, too gravely looking at me. He seems to stand,                                                       And looking at Him, if my forgotten spirit came                                                               Unwillingly back, what could it claim                                                               Of those calm eyes, that quiet speech,                                                       Breaking like a slow tide upon the beach,                                                               The scarred, not quite human hand ?—                                          Unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings                                          When it has learned so long not to think, not to be,                 Again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things                                                                That I shall not see!                     I cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head:                        When I was small I never quite believed that He was dead:                            And at the Convent school I used to lie awake in bed                 Thinking about His hands. It did not matter what they said,        He was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! And most of all in Holy Week                                         When there was no one else to see                                 I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly,                                                  If He had ever seemed to notice me                                                  Or, if, for once, He would only speak.   "
"   The town is old and very steep       A place of bells and cloisters and grey towers,   And black-clad people walking in their sleep—        A nun, a priest, a woman taking flowers        To her new grave; and watched from end to end        By the great Church above, through the still hours:            But in the morning and the early dark   The children wake to dart from doors and call   Down the wide, crooked street, where, at the bend,            Before it climbs up to the park,   Ken’s is in the gabled house facing the Castle wall.       When first I came upon him there   Suddenly, on the half-lit stair,   I think I hardly found a trace   Of likeness to a human face        In his. And I said then   If in His image God made men,   Some other must have made poor Ken—   But for his eyes which looked at you   As two red, wounded stars might do.       He scarcely spoke, you scarcely heard,   His voice broke off in little jars   To tears sometimes. An uncouth bird        He seemed as he ploughed up the street,   Groping, with knarred, high-lifted feet        And arms thrust out as if to beat             Always against a threat of bars.            And oftener than not there’d be        A child just higher than his knee   Trotting beside him. Through his dim        Long twilight this, at least, shone clear,        That all the children and the deer,           Whom every day he went to see   Out in the park, belonged to him.                “God help the folk that next him sits            He fidgets so, with his poor wits,”   The neighbours said on Sunday nights   When he would go to Church to “see the lights!”        Although for these he used to fix                                                                  His eyes upon a crucifix        In a dark corner, staring on       Till everybody else had gone.       And sometimes, in his evil fits,   You could not move him from his chair—   You did not look at him as he sat there,        Biting his rosary to bits.   While pointing to the Christ he tried to say,       “Take it away”.            Nothing was dead:   He said “a bird” if he picked up a broken wing,        A perished leaf or any such thing        Was just “a rose”; and once when I had said     He must not stand and knock there any more,     He left a twig on the mat outside my door.            Not long ago   The last thrush stiffened in the snow,       While black against a sullen sky          The sighing pines stood by.   But now the wind has left our rattled pane   To flutter the hedge-sparrow’s wing,   The birches in the wood are red again          And only yesterday   The larks went up a little way to sing          What lovers say      Who loiter in the lanes to-day;      The buds begin to talk of May      With learned rooks on city trees,           And if God please          With all of these   We, too, shall see another Spring.       But in that red brick barn upon the hill       I wonder—can one own the deer,   And does one walk with children still           As one did here?           Do roses grow   Beneath those twenty windows in a row—           And if some night   When you have not seen any light   They cannot move you from your chair           What happens there?            I do not know.              So, when they took   Ken to that place, I did not look   After he called and turned on me   His eyes. These I shall see—   "
"   To-night again the moon’s white mat          Stretches across the dormitory floor   While outside, like an evil cat          The pion prowls down the dark corridor,          Planning, I know, to pounce on me, in spite   For getting leave to sleep in town last night.   But it was none of us who made that noise,          Only the old brown owl that hoots and flies   Out of the ivy—he will say it was us boys—          Seigneur mon Dieu: the sacré soul of spies!          He would like to catch each dream that lies              Hidden behind our sleepy eyes:   Their dream? But mine—it is the moon and the wood that sees;   All my long life how I shall hate the trees!       In the Place d’Armes the dusty planes, all Summer through,   Dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred          To see the quiet things that crossed the Square—,   A tiny funeral, the flying shadow of a bird,          The hump-backed barber Célestin Lemaire,          Old Madame Michel in her three-wheeled chair,                 And filing past to Vespers, two and two,                 The demoiselles of the pensionnat   Towed like a ship through the harbour bar,          Safe into port, where le petit Jésus    Perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you:          Si, c’est défendu, mais que voulez-vous?    It was the sun. The sunshine weaves   A pattern on dull stones: the sunshine leaves          The portraiture of dreams upon the eyes                 Before it dies:          All Summer through   The dust hung white upon the drowsy planes   Till suddenly they woke with the Autumn rains.              It is not only the little boys         Who have hardly got away from toys,   But I, who am seventeen next year,   Some nights, in bed, have grown cold to hear         That lonely passion of the rain   Which makes you think of being dead,   And of somewhere living to lay your head          As if you were a child again,   Crying for one thing, known and near   Your empty heart, to still the hunger and the fear       That pelts and beats with it against the pane.                     But I remember smiling too   At all the sun’s soft tricks and those Autumn dreads       In winter time, when the grey light broke slowly through   The frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds.        And when at dusk the singing wind swung down   Straight from the stars to the dark country roads                        Beyond the twinkling town,       Striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by,   Like some poor, stray dog by the wayside lying dead,   We left behind us the old world of dread,   I and the wind as we strode whistling on under the Winter sky.       And then in Spring for three days came the Fair       Just as the planes were starting into bud   Above the caravans: you saw the dancing bear       Pass on his chain; and heard the jingle and the thud.               Only four days ago               They let you out of this dull show   To slither down the montagne russe and chaff the man à la tête de veau                Hit, slick, the bull's eye at the tir,   Spin round and round till your head went queer   On the porcs-roulants. Oh! là là! fête! Va pour du vin, et le tête-a-tête    With the girl who sugars the gaufres! Pauvrette,       How thin she was! but she smiled, you bet,           As she took your tip—“One does not forget   The good days, Monsieur”. Said with a grace,   But sacrebleu: what a ghost of a face!       And no fun too for the demoiselles   Of the pensionnat, who were hurried past,       With their “Oh, que c’est beau—Ah, qu’elle est belle!”   A lap-dog’s life from first to last! ;   The good nights are not made for sleep, nor the good days for dreaming in,       And at the end in the big Circus tent we sat and shook and stewed like sin!           Some children there had got—but where?   Sent from the south, perhaps—a red bouquet       Of roses, sweetening the fetid air   With scent from gardens by some far away blue bay.       They threw one at the dancing bear;   The white clown caught it. From St. Rémy’s tower       The deep, slow bell tolled out the hour;   The black clown, with his dirty grin       Lay, sprawling in the dust, as She rode in.       She stood on a white horse—and suddenly you saw the bend       Of a far-off road at dawn, with knights riding by,   A field of spears—and then the gallant day   Go out in storm, with ragged clouds low down, sullen and grey       Against red heavens: wild and awful, such a sky       As witnesses against you at the end   Of a great battle; bugles blowing, blood and dust—   The old Morte d’Arthur, fight you must—.       It died in anger. But it was not death       That had you by the throat, stopping your breath.   She looked like Victory. She rode my way.       She laughed at the black clown and then she flew                A bird above us, on the wing   Of her white arms; and you saw through   A rent in the old tent, a patch of sky   With one dim star. She flew, but not so high—                And then she did not fly;   She stood in the bright moonlight at the door   Of a strange room, she threw her slippers on the floor—                       Again, again                 You heard the patter of the rain,                 The starving rain—it was this Thing,   Summer was this, the gold mist in your eyes;—                        Oh God! it dies,                        But after death—,       To-night the splendour and the sting       Blows back and catches at your breath,   The smell of beasts, the smell of dust, the scent of all the roses in the world,                    the sea, the Spring,   The beat of drums, the pad of hoofs, music, the dream, the dream, the                    Enchanted Thing!           At first you scarcely saw her face,       You knew the maddening feet were there,   What called was that half-hidden, white unrest   To which now and then she pressed       Her finger-tips; but as she slackened pace   And turned and looked at you it grew quite bare:                There was not anything you did not dare:—   Like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the Fair.           In the Place d’Armes all afternoon       The building birds had sung “Soon, soon”,   The shuttered streets slept sound that night,                         It was full moon:   The path into the wood was almost white,   The trees were very still and seemed to stare:       Not far before your soul the Dream flits on,       But when you touch it, it is gone   And quite alone your soul stands there.       Mother of Christ, no one has seen your eyes: how can men pray                       Even unto you?   There were only wolves’ eyes in the wood—                       My Mother is a woman too:   Nothing is true that is not good,   With that quick smile of hers, I have heard her say;—   I wish I had gone back home to-day;       I should have watched the light that so gently dies       From our high window, in the Paris skies,                       The long, straight chain       Of lamps hung out along the Seine:   I would have turned to her and let the rain   Beat on her breast as it does against the pane;—       Nothing will be the same again;—   There is something strange in my little Mother’s eyes,   There is something new in the old heavenly air of Spring—   The smell of beasts, the smell of dust—The Enchanted Thing!       All my life long I shall see moonlight on the fern       And the black trunks of trees. Only the hair   Of any woman can belong to God.   The stalks are cruelly broken where we trod,                        There had been violets there,                        I shall not care   As I used to do when I see the bracken burn.   "
"   Not yet will those measureless fields be green again Where only yesterday the wild sweet blood of wonderful youth was shed; There is a grave whose earth must hold too long, too deep a stain, Though for ever over it we may speak as proudly as we may tread. But here, where the watchers by lonely hearths from the thrust of an inward sword have more slowly bled, We shall build the Cenotaph: Victory, winged, with Peace, winged too, at the column's head. And over the stairway, at the foot—oh! here, leave desolate, passionate hands to spread Violets, roses, and laurel with the small sweet twinkling country things Speaking so wistfully of other Springs From the little gardens of little places where son or sweetheart was born and bred. In splendid sleep, with a thousand brothers      To lovers—to mothers      Here, too, lies he: Under the purple, the green, the red, It is all young life: it must break some women's hearts to see Such a brave, gay coverlet to such a bed! Only, when all is done and said, God is not mocked and neither are the dead.  For this will stand in our Market-place—      Who'll sell, who'll buy      (Will you or I Lie each to each with the better grace)? While looking into every busy whore's and huckster's face As they drive their bargains, is the Face Of God: and some young, piteous, murdered face.   "
"   I feel the spring far off, far off,    The faint, far scent of bud and leaf— Oh, how can spring take heart to come    To a world in grief,    Deep grief?   The sun turns north, the days grow long,    Later the evening star grows bright— How can the daylight linger on    For men to fight,    Still fight?   The grass is waking in the ground,    Soon it will rise and blow in waves— How can it have the heart to sway    Over the graves,    New graves?   Under the boughs where lovers walked    The apple-blooms will shed their breath— But what of all the lovers now    Parted by Death,    Grey Death?   "
"   First, are you our sort of a person?   Do you wear   A glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,   A brace or a hook,   Rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,   Stitches to show something's missing? No, no? Then   How can we give you a thing?   Stop crying.   Open your hand.   Empty? Empty. Here is a hand   To fill it and willing   To bring teacups and roll away headaches   And do whatever you tell it.   Will you marry it?   It is guaranteed   To thumb shut your eyes at the end   And dissolve of sorrow.   We make new stock from the salt.   I notice you are stark naked.   How about this suit——   Black and stiff, but not a bad fit.   Will you marry it?   It is waterproof, shatterproof, proof   Against fire and bombs through the roof.   Believe me, they'll bury you in it.   Now your head, excuse me, is empty.   I have the ticket for that.   Come here, sweetie, out of the closet.   Well, what do you think of that?   Naked as paper to start   But in twenty-five years she'll be silver,   In fifty, gold.   A living doll, everywhere you look.   It can sew, it can cook,   It can talk, talk, talk.   It works, there is nothing wrong with it.   You have a hole, it's a poultice.   You have an eye, it's an image.   My boy, it's your last resort.   Will you marry it, marry it, marry it.   "
"   The kings they came from out the south,    All dressed in ermine fine;  They bore Him gold and chrysoprase,    And gifts of precious wine.   The shepherds came from out the north,    Their coats were brown and old;  They brought Him little new-born lambs—    They had not any gold.   The wise men came from out the east,    And they were wrapped in white;  The star that led them all the way    Did glorify the night.   The angels came from heaven high,    And they were clad with wings;  And lo, they brought a joyful song    The host of heaven sings.   The kings they knocked upon the door,    The wise men entered in,  The shepherds followed after them    To hear the song begin.   The angels sang through all the night    Until the rising sun,  But little Jesus fell asleep    Before the song was done.   "
"   I shall never get you put together entirely,   Pieced, glued, and properly jointed.   Mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles   Proceed from your great lips.   It’s worse than a barnyard.       Perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,   Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.   Thirty years now I have labored   To dredge the silt from your throat.   I am none the wiser.       Scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol   I crawl like an ant in mourning   Over the weedy acres of your brow   To mend the immense skull plates and clear   The bald, white tumuli of your eyes.       A blue sky out of the Oresteia   Arches above us. O father, all by yourself   You are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum.   I open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.   Your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered       In their old anarchy to the horizon-line.   It would take more than a lightning-stroke   To create such a ruin.   Nights, I squat in the cornucopia   Of your left ear, out of the wind,       Counting the red stars and those of plum-color.   The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.   My hours are married to shadow.   No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel   On the blank stones of the landing.       "
"   I must have passed the crest a while ago    And now I am going down.Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know—    But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown.All the morning I thought how proud it would be    To stand there straight as a queen—Wrapped in the wind and the sun, with the world under me.    But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.It was nearly level along the beaten track    And the brambles caught in my gown—But it’s no use now to think of turning back,    The rest of the way will be only going down.

"   Life has loveliness to sell,        All beautiful and splendid things,   Blue waves whitened on a cliff,        Soaring fire that sways and sings,   And children's faces looking up   Holding wonder like a cup.   Life has loveliness to sell,        Music like a curve of gold,   Scent of pine trees in the rain,        Eyes that love you, arms that hold,   And for your spirit's still delight,   Holy thoughts that star the night.   Spend all you have for loveliness,        Buy it and never count the cost;   For one white singing hour of peace        Count many a year of strife well lost,   And for a breath of ecstasy   Give all you have been, or could be.   "
"   Supper comes at five o'clock,   At six, the evening star,   My lover comes at eight o'clock—   But eight o'clock is far.   How could I bear my pain all day   Unless I watched to see   The clock-hands laboring to bring   Eight o'clock to me.   "
"   They came to tell your faults to me,They named them over one by one;I laughed aloud when they were done,I knew them all so well before, —Oh, they were blind, too blind to seeYour faults had made me love you more.   "
"   I love to watch them sheathe themselves mid-air,   shut wings and ride the light’s poor spine   to earth, to touch down in gutters, in the rainbowed   urine of suicides, just outside Bellevue’s walls.   From in there the ransacked cadavers are carried   up the East River to Potter’s Field   as if they were an inheritance,   gleaned of saveable parts,   their diseases jarred and labeled, or incinerated,   the ashes of metastisized vision   professing the virus that lives beyond the flesh   in air ...                                    The first time I saw the inside of anything   alive, a downed bird opened cleanly   under my heel. I knelt   to watch the spectral innards shine and quicken,   the heart-whir magnify.   And though I can’t say now what kind of bird it was,   nor the season, spring or autumn, what   dangerous transition,   I have identified so many times that sudden   earnest spasm of the throat in children,   or in the jaundiced faces of the dying,   the lower eye-lids straining upward.   Fear needs its metaphors.   I’ve read small helplessnesses make us maternal.   Even the sparrows feel it,   nesting this evening in traffic lights.   They must have remembered, long enough to mate,   woods they’ve never seen,   but woods inbred up the long light of instinct,   the streaked siennas of a forest floor   born now into the city,   the oak umbers, and the white tuft   of tail feathers like a milkweed meadow   in which their song, as Burroughs heard it,   could be distinguished:come-come-where-where-all-together-   down-the-hill ..."
"   Since there is no escape, since at the end   My body will be utterly destroyed,   This hand I love as I have loved a friend,   This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;   Since there is no escape even for me   Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:   The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea   And hours alone too still and sure for prayer—   Since darkness waits for me, then all the more   Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore   In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;   In these few hours of light I lift my head;   Life is my lover—I shall leave the dead   If there is any way to baffle death.   "
"   You do not do, you do not do      Any more, black shoe   In which I have lived like a foot      For thirty years, poor and white,      Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.      You died before I had time——   Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,      Ghastly statue with one gray toe      Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic      Where it pours bean green over blue      In the waters off beautiful Nauset.      I used to pray to recover you.   Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town      Scraped flat by the roller   Of wars, wars, wars.   But the name of the town is common.      My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.      So I never could tell where you      Put your foot, your root,   I never could talk to you.   The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.      Ich, ich, ich, ich,   I could hardly speak.   I thought every German was you.      And the language obscene   An engine, an engine   Chuffing me off like a Jew.   A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.      I began to talk like a Jew.   I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna      Are not very pure or true.   With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck      And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack   I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,   With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.      And your neat mustache   And your Aryan eye, bright blue.   Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika   So black no sky could squeak through.      Every woman adores a Fascist,      The boot in the face, the brute      Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,      In the picture I have of you,   A cleft in your chin instead of your foot      But no less a devil for that, no not      Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.   I was ten when they buried you.      At twenty I tried to die   And get back, back, back to you.   I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,      And they stuck me together with glue.      And then I knew what to do.   I made a model of you,   A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.      And I said I do, I do.   So daddy, I’m finally through.   The black telephone’s off at the root,      The voices just can’t worm through.   If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——   The vampire who said he was you      And drank my blood for a year,   Seven years, if you want to know.   Daddy, you can lie back now.   There’s a stake in your fat black heart      And the villagers never liked you.   They are dancing and stamping on you.      They always knew it was you.   Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.   "
"   Stasis in darkness.   Then the substanceless blue      Pour of tor and distances.   God’s lioness,      How one we grow,   Pivot of heels and knees!—The furrow   Splits and passes, sister to      The brown arc   Of the neck I cannot catch,   Nigger-eye      Berries cast dark      Hooks—   Black sweet blood mouthfuls,      Shadows.   Something else   Hauls me through air—   Thighs, hair;   Flakes from my heels.   White   Godiva, I unpeel—   Dead hands, dead stringencies.   And now I   Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.      The child’s cry   Melts in the wall.      And I   Am the arrow,   The dew that flies   Suicidal, at one with the drive      Into the red   Eye, the cauldron of morning.   "
"            For Ruth Fainlight            I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:      It is what you fear.   I do not fear it: I have been there.   Is it the sea you hear in me,      Its dissatisfactions?   Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?   Love is a shadow.   How you lie and cry after it   Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse.   All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously,   Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,      Echoing, echoing.   Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons?      This is rain now, this big hush.   And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic.   I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.      Scorched to the root   My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires.   Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs.      A wind of such violence   Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek.   The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me      Cruelly, being barren.   Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her.   I let her go. I let her go   Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery.      How your bad dreams possess and endow me.   I am inhabited by a cry.      Nightly it flaps out   Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.   I am terrified by this dark thing      That sleeps in me;   All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.   Clouds pass and disperse.   Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?      Is it for such I agitate my heart?   I am incapable of more knowledge.      What is this, this face   So murderous in its strangle of branches?——   Its snaky acids hiss.   It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults      That kill, that kill, that kill.   "
"   Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,      Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,   A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea   Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries   Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes   Ebon in the hedges, fat   With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers.   I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.   They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.   Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks—   Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky.   Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting.   I do not think the sea will appear at all.   The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within.   I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,   Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen.   The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.      One more hook, and the berries and bushes end.   The only thing to come now is the sea.   From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,      Slapping its phantom laundry in my face.   These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt.   I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me      To the hills’ northern face, and the face is orange rock      That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space      Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths      Beating and beating at an intractable metal.   "
"   I am a miner. The light burns blue.      Waxy stalactites   Drip and thicken, tears   The earthen womb   Exudes from its dead boredom.      Black bat airs   Wrap me, raggy shawls,      Cold homicides.   They weld to me like plums.   Old cave of calcium      Icicles, old echoer.   Even the newts are white,   Those holy Joes.   And the fish, the fish—   Christ! they are panes of ice,   A vice of knives,      A piranha      Religion, drinking   Its first communion out of my live toes.      The candle   Gulps and recovers its small altitude,   Its yellows hearten.   O love, how did you get here?      O embryo   Remembering, even in sleep,      Your crossed position.      The blood blooms clean   In you, ruby.      The pain   You wake to is not yours.   Love, love,   I have hung our cave with roses,      With soft rugs—   The last of Victoriana.      Let the stars   Plummet to their dark address,   Let the mercuric      Atoms that cripple drip      Into the terrible well,   You are the one   Solid the spaces lean on, envious.      You are the baby in the barn.   "
"   Love set you going like a fat gold watch.   The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry      Took its place among the elements.   Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.   In a drafty museum, your nakedness   Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.   I’m no more your mother   Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow   Effacement at the wind’s hand.   All night your moth-breath   Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:   A far sea moves in my ear.   One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral   In my Victorian nightgown.   Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s. The window square   Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try   Your handful of notes;   The clear vowels rise like balloons.   "
"   The woman is perfected.      Her dead   Body wears the smile of accomplishment,      The illusion of a Greek necessity   Flows in the scrolls of her toga,      Her bare   Feet seem to be saying:   We have come so far, it is over.   Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,      One at each little   Pitcher of milk, now empty.      She has folded   Them back into her body as petals      Of a rose close when the garden   Stiffens and odors bleed   From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.   The moon has nothing to be sad about,      Staring from her hood of bone.   She is used to this sort of thing.   Her blacks crackle and drag.   "
"   Clownlike, happiest on your hands,      Feet to the stars, and moon-skulled,      Gilled like a fish. A common-sense      Thumbs-down on the dodo’s mode.      Wrapped up in yourself like a spool,      Trawling your dark as owls do.      Mute as a turnip from the Fourth      Of July to All Fools’ Day,   O high-riser, my little loaf.   Vague as fog and looked for like mail.      Farther off than Australia.   Bent-backed Atlas, our traveled prawn.      Snug as a bud and at home      Like a sprat in a pickle jug.      A creel of eels, all ripples.      Jumpy as a Mexican bean.      Right, like a well-done sum.      A clean slate, with your own face on.   "
"   The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.   Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly   As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.   They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.   Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.   The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,   They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,   Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.   My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water   Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.   They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——   My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.   I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat      stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.   They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.   I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted   To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.   How free it is, you have no idea how free——   The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,   And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.   It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.   Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.   They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.   Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me   Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.   Before they came the air was calm enough,   Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.   Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.      They concentrate my attention, that was happy      Playing and resting without committing itself.   The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.   The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes   Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.   The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,   And comes from a country far away as health.   "
"            —and he cried with a loud voice:    Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees—    (Revelation)             They are cutting down the great plane-trees at the end of the gardens.   For days there has been the grate of the saw, the swish of the branches as they fall,   The crash of the trunks, the rustle of trodden leaves,   With the ‘Whoops’ and the ‘Whoas,’ the loud common talk, the loud common laughs of the men, above it all.   I remember one evening of a long past Spring   Turning in at a gate, getting out of a cart, and finding a large dead rat in the mud of the drive.   I remember thinking: alive or dead, a rat was a god-forsaken thing,   But at least, in May, that even a rat should be alive.   The week’s work here is as good as done. There is just one bough      On the roped bole, in the fine grey rain,                Green and high                And lonely against the sky.                      (Down now!—)                And but for that,                   If an old dead rat   Did once, for a moment, unmake the Spring, I might never have thought of him again.   It is not for a moment the Spring is unmade to-day;   These were great trees, it was in them from root to stem:   When the men with the ‘Whoops’ and the ‘Whoas’ have carted the whole of the whispering loveliness away   Half the Spring, for me, will have gone with them.   It is going now, and my heart has been struck with the hearts of the planes;   Half my life it has beat with these, in the sun, in the rains,                   In the March wind, the May breeze,   In the great gales that came over to them across the roofs from the great seas.                There was only a quiet rain when they were dying;                They must have heard the sparrows flying,      And the small creeping creatures in the earth where they were lying—                But I, all day, I heard an angel crying:                ‘Hurt not the trees.’   "
"   I went out at night alone; The young blood flowing beyond the seaSeemed to have drenched my spirit’s wings— I bore my sorrow heavily.But when I lifted up my head From shadows shaken on the snow,I saw Orion in the east Burn steadily as long ago.From windows in my father’s house, Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,I watched Orion as a girl Above another city’s lights.Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too, The world’s heart breaks beneath its wars,All things are changed, save in the east The faithful beauty of the stars.   "
"   In my heart the old love      Struggled with the new,   It was ghostly waking      All night through.    Dear things, kind things      That my old love said,   Ranged themselves reproachfully      Round my bed.    But I could not heed them,      For I seemed to see   Dark eyes of my new love      Fixed on me.    Old love, old love,      How can I be true?   Shall I be faithless to myself      Or to you?   "
"   I   Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower          Ring on, ring on unendingly,   Make all the hours a single hour,      For when the dusk begins to flower,          The man I love will come to me! ...   But no, go slowly as you will,       I should not bid you hasten so,      For while I wait for love to come,      Some other girl is standing dumb,       Fearing her love will go.          II   Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!          Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!      Oh sun awake in the covered sky,       For the man I love, loves me! ...   Oh drifting steam disperse and die,       Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,—   Fate heard afar my happy cry,       And laid her finger on my mouth.          III   The dusk was blue with blowing mist,          The lights were spangles in a veil,      And from the clamor far below       Floated faint music like a wail.   It voiced what I shall never speak,       My heart was breaking all night long,   But when the dawn was hard and gray,          My tears distilled into a song.          IV   I said, “I have shut my heart          As one shuts an open door,   That Love may starve therein          And trouble me no more.”   But over the roofs there came       The wet new wind of May,   And a tune blew up from the curb       Where the street-pianos play.   My room was white with the sun          And Love cried out to me,   “I am strong, I will break your heart          Unless you set me free.”   "
"   What do I owe to you            Who loved me deep and long?  You never gave my spirit wings      Nor gave my heart a song.    But oh, to him I loved,            Who loved me not at all,  I owe the little open gate      That led through heaven’s wall.   "
"   Lyric night of the lingering Indian Summer, Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing,  Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects,        Ceaseless, insistent.   The grasshopper’s horn, and far-off, high in the maples,  The wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence  Under a moon waning and worn, broken,        Tired with summer.    Let me remember you, voices of little insects, Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters,  Let me remember, soon will the winter be on us,       Snow-hushed and heavy.   Over my soul murmur your mute benediction, While I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest, As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to,        Lest they forget them.   "

"   Strephon kissed me in the spring,      Robin in the fall, But Colin only looked at me      And never kissed at all. Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,      Robin's lost in play, But the kiss in Colin's eyes      Haunts me night and day.    "
"   With the man I love who loves me not,      I walked in the street-lamps' flare; We watched the world go home that night      In a flood through Union Square. I leaned to catch the words he said      That were light as a snowflake falling; Ah well that he never leaned to hear      The words my heart was calling. And on we walked and on we walked      Past the fiery lights of the picture shows — Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by      On the errand each man knows. And on we walked and on we walked,      At the door at last we said good-bye; I knew by his smile he had not heard      My heart's unuttered cry. With the man I love who loves me not      I walked in the street-lamps' flare — But oh, the girls who ask for love      In the lights of Union Square.    "
"   When I am dead and over me bright April      Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,      I shall not care. I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful      When rain bends down the bough, And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted      Than you are now.    "
"   Let it be forgotten, as a flower is forgotten,   Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold,   Let it be forgotten for ever and ever,   Time is a kind friend, he will make us old.   If anyone asks, say it was forgotten   Long and long ago,   As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall   In a long forgotten snow.   "
"   Inside the starboard window   of his room in a boat at sea,   the piece of earth he's scraped from a dead gull’s leg      sprouts eighty different species, green      under bell glass. By the sunlight      of the oil lamp he makes rain      as the wind picks up toward Chiloe,      Port Famine, Concepcion, and then Galapagos.   Here he finds shipwrecked sailors’ epitaphs cut   into the shell of an old tortoise      who’s tame enough to ride,   too huge to slaughter.   Here the birds are fearless.   He can catch them with his hands, let them      perch on his finger before he   breaks their necks and wraps them   in his shirt and sets their eggs on branches drifting   from the shoreline, island to island.      Now everywhere he meets himself.   He’s tired, and half the world from home.      But his mind has entered the morning      the way all the animals   kept in his cabin in jars along the wall grow      smaller in sequence   until the window opens on the sea,      so that what he’ll remember   are the wasted spaces, the desert rock spread out for miles      as if the earth were flat again,      dangerous at the horizon,   where the stones, piled, shine   against lava black.   Dew pools in the evenings.   A few pale leaves appear.   "
"I so liked Spring last year  Because you were here;-  The thrushes too-  Because it was these you so liked to hear-  I so liked you.    This year's a different thing,-  I'll not think of you.  But I'll like the Spring because it is simply spring  As the thrushes do."
"Tide be runnin' the great world over:  'Twas only last June month I mind that we  Was thinkin' the toss and the call in the breast of the lover  So everlastin' as the sea.    Heer's the same little fishes that sputter an swim,  Wi' the moon's old glim on the grey, wet sand;  An' him no more to me mor me to him  Than the wind goin' over my hand."
"We passed each other, turned and stopped for half an hour, then went our way,  I who make other women smile did not make you--  But no man can move mountains in a day.  So this hard thing is yet to do.    But first I want your life:--before I die I want to see  The world that lies behind the strangeness of your eyes,  There is nothing gay or green there for my gathering, it may be,  Yet on brown fields there lies  A haunting purple bloom: is there not something in grey skies  And in grey sea?  I want what world there is behind your eyes,  I want your life and you will not give it me.    Now, if I look, I see you walking down the years,  Young, and through August fields--a face, a thought, a swinging dream  perched on a stile--;  I would have liked (so vile we are!) to have taught you tears  But most to have made you smile.  To-day is not enough or yesterday: God sees it all--  Your length on sunny lawns, the wakeful rainy nights--; tell me--;  (how vain to ask), but it is not a question--just a call--;  Show me then, only your notched inches climbing up the garden wall,  I like you best when you are small.    Is this a stupid thing to say  Not having spent with you one day?  No matter; I shall never touch your hair  Or hear the little tick behind your breast,  Still it is there,  And as a flying bird  Brushes the branches where it may not rest  I have brushed your hand and heard  The child in you: I like that best  So small, so dark, so sweet; and were you also then too grave and wise?  Always I think. Then put your far off little hand in mine;--  Oh! let it rest;  I will not stare into the early world beyond the opening eyes,  Or vex or scare what I love best.  But I want your life before mine bleeds away--  Here--not in heavenly hereafters--soon,--  I want your smile this very afternoon,  (The last of all my vices, pleasant people used to say,  I wanted and I sometimes got--the Moon!)    You know, at dusk, the last bird's cry,  And round the house the flap of the bat's low flight,  Trees that go black against the sky  And then--how soon the night!    No shadow of you on any bright road again,  And at the darkening end of this--what voice? whose kiss? As if you'd say!  It is not I who have walked with you, it will not be I who take away  Peace, peace, my little handful of the gleaner's grain  From your reaped fields at the shut of day.    Peace! Would you not rather die  Reeling,--with all the cannons at your ear?  So, at least, would I,  And I may not be here  To-night, to-morrow morning or next year.  Still I will let you keep your life a little while,  See dear?  I have made you smile."
"My heart is lame with running after yours so fast  Such a long way,  Shall we walk slowly home, looking at all the things we passed  Perhaps to-day?    Home down the quiet evening roads under the quiet skies,  Not saying much,  You for a moment giving me your eyes  When you could bear my touch.    But not to-morrow. This has taken all my breath;  Then, though you look the same,  There may be something lovelier in Love's face in death  As your heart sees it, running back the way we came;  My heart is lame."
"Seventeen years ago you said  Something that sounded like Good-bye;  And everybody thinks that you are dead,  But I.    So I, as I grow stiff and cold  To this and that say Good-bye too;  And everybody sees that I am old  But you.    And one fine morning in a sunny lane  Some boy and girl will meet and kiss and swear  That nobody can love their way again  While over there  You will have smiled, I shall have tossed your hair."
"Oh Amber Eyes, oh Golden Eyes!       Oh Eyes so softly gay!     Wherein swift fancies fall and rise,       Grow dark and fade away.     Eyes like a little limpid pool       That holds a sunset sky,     While on its surface, calm and cool,       Blue water lilies lie.       Oh Tender Eyes, oh Wistful Eyes,       You smiled on me one day,     And all my life, in glad surprise,       Leapt up and pleaded ""Stay!""     Alas, oh cruel, starlike eyes,       So grave and yet so gay,     You went to lighten other skies,       Smiled once and passed away.       Oh, you whom I name ""Golden Eyes,""       Perhaps I used to know     Your beauty under other skies       In lives lived long ago.     Perhaps I rowed with galley slaves,       Whose labour never ceased,     To bring across Phoenician waves       Your treasure from the East.       Maybe you were an Emperor then       And I a favourite slave;     Some youth, whom from the lions' den       You vainly tried to save!     Maybe I reigned, a mighty King,       The early nations knew,     And you were some slight captive thing,       Some maiden whom I slew.       Perhaps, adrift on desert shores       Beside some shipwrecked prow,     I gladly gave my life for yours.       Would I might give it now!     Or on some sacrificial stone       Strange Gods we satisfied,     Perhaps you stooped and left a throne       To kiss me ere I died.       Perhaps, still further back than this,       In times ere men were men,     You granted me a moment's bliss       In some dark desert den,     When, with your amber eyes alight       With iridescent flame,     And fierce desire for love's delight,       Towards my lair you came       Ah laughing, ever-brilliant eyes,       These things men may not know,     But something in your radiance lies,       That, centuries ago,     Lit up my life in one wild blaze       Of infinite desire     To revel in your golden rays,       Or in your light expire.       If this, oh Strange Ringed Eyes, be true,       That through all changing lives     This longing love I have for you       Eternally survives,     May I not sometimes dare to dream       In some far time to be     Your softly golden eyes may gleam       Responsively on me?       Ah gentle, subtly changing eyes,       You smiled on me one day,     And all my life in glad surprise       Leaped up, imploring ""Stay!""     Alas, alas, oh Golden Eyes,       So cruel and so gay,     You went to shine in other skies,       Smiled once and passed away."
"Less than the dust, beneath thy Chariot wheel,     Less than the rust, that never stained thy Sword,     Less than the trust thou hast in me, O Lord,                                  Even less than these!       Less than the weed, that grows beside thy door,     Less than the speed of hours spent far from thee,     Less than the need thou hast in life of me.                                  Even less am I.       Since I, O Lord, am nothing unto thee,     See here thy Sword, I make it keen and bright,     Love's last reward, Death, comes to me to-night,                                  Farewell,  Zahir-u-din."
"  After the Hazara War       I lie alone beneath the Almond blossoms,          Where we two lay together in the spring,     And now, as then, the mountain snows are melting,          This year, as last, the water-courses sing.       That was another spring, and other flowers,          Hung, pink and fragile, on the leafless tree,     The land rejoiced in other running water,          And I rejoiced, because you were with me.       You, with your soft eyes, darkly lashed and shaded,          Your red lips like a living, laughing rose,     Your restless, amber limbs so lithe and slender          Now lost to me.  Gone whither no man knows.       You lay beside me singing in the sunshine;          The rough, white fur, unloosened at the neck,     Showed the smooth skin, fair as the Almond blossoms,          On which the sun could find no flaw or fleck.       I lie alone, beneath the Almond flowers,          I hated them to touch you as they fell.     And now, who killed you? worse, Ah, worse, who loves you?          (My soul is burning as men burn in Hell.)       How I have sought you in the crowded cities!          I have been mad, they say, for many days.     I know not how I came here, to the valley,          What fate has led me, through what doubtful ways.       Somewhere I see my sword has done good service,          Some one I killed, who, smiling, used your name,     But in what country?  Nay, I have forgotten,          All thought is shrivelled in my heart's hot flame.       Where are you now, Delight, and where your beauty,          Your subtle curls, and laughing, changeful face?     Bound, bruised and naked (dear God, grant me patience),          And sold in Cabul in the market-place.       I asked of you of all men.  Who could tell me?          Among so many captured, sold, or slain,     What fate was yours?  (Ah, dear God, grant me patience,          My heart is burnt, is burnt, with fire and pain.)       Oh, lost Delight! my heart is almost breaking,          My sword is broken and my feet are sore,     The people look at me and say in passing,          ""He will not leave the village any more.""       For as the evening falls, the fever rises,          With frantic thoughts careering through the brain,     Wild thoughts of you.  (Ah, dear God, grant me patience,          My soul is hurt beyond all men call pain.)       I lie alone, beneath the Almond blossoms,          And see the white snow melting on the hills     Till Khorassan is gay with water-courses,          Glad with the tinkling sound of running rills,       And well I know that when the fragile petals          Fall softly, ere the first green leaves appear,     (Ah, for these last few days, God, grant me patience,)          Since Delight is not, I shall not be, here!"
" Rose-colour     Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows       In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors     By which, in time of love, love's essence flows       From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.     Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours       Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.       On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek       I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,     Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak       I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light.       Azure     Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,       Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,     Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,       Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.       Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,       Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,     All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,       Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.       Scarlet     Hail! to the Royal Red of living Blood,       Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,     Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn       Staining the patient gates of life new born.       Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,       Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,     Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,       Raiment of women women may not name.       I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,       Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,     The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,       Hail! to the Royal Purple Red of Wine.       Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,       In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.     Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,       The two red cards in Life's unequal game.       Green     I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,       Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,     Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,       Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.       Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,       Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.     See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,       Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.       Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever       Something is wanting, something falls behind;     The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never       That light and lovely summer men divined.       Violet     I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)           That are hard to name.     Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call ""mad""           Or oftener ""shame.""     Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,           So reticent, rare,     Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,           In this Eastern air.       On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,           With its edges curled;     And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell           In a perfumed world.     My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky           Where the sunset clings.     My purple lends an Imperial Majesty           To the robes of kings.       Yellow     Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,       Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.     A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,       Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.       Thus they discoursed in the daytime, - Violet, Yellow, and Blue,       Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.     Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,       Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest."
"Oh, that my blood were water, thou athirst,     And thou and I in some far Desert land,     How would I shed it gladly, if but first     It touched thy lips, before it reached the sand.       Once, - Ah, the Gods were good to me, - I threw     Myself upon a poison snake, that crept     Where my Beloved - a lesser love we knew     Than this which now consumes me wholly - slept.       But thou; Alas, what can I do for thee?     By Fate, and thine own beauty, set above     The need of all or any aid from me,     Too high for service, as too far for love."
"   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,              Across green fields, the blue green sea,     You knew the little weary feet              Of my child bride that was to be!       Her people brought her from the shore              One golden day in sultry June,     And I stood, waiting, at the door,              Praying my eyes might see her soon.       With eager arms, wide open thrown,              Now never to be satisfied!     Ere I could make my love my own              She closed her amber eyes and died.       Alas! alas! they took no heed              How frail she was, my little one,     But brought her here with cruel speed              Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.       We laid her on the marriage bed              The bridal flowers in her hand,     A maiden from the ocean led              Only, alas! to die inland.       I walk alone; the air is sweet,              The white road wanders to the sea,     I dream of those two little feet              That grew so tired in reaching me."
"Since, Oh, Beloved, you are not even faithful       To me, who loved you so, for one short night,     For one brief space of darkness, though my absence       Did but endure until the dawning light;       Since all your beauty - which was mine - you squandered       On that which now lies dead across your door;     See here this knife, made keen and bright to kill you.       You shall not see the sun rise any more.       Lie still!  Lie still!  In all the empty village       Who is there left to hear or heed your cry?     All are gone to labour in the valley,       Who will return before your time to die?       No use to struggle; when I found you sleeping,       I took your hands and bound them to your side,     And both these slender feet, too apt at straying,       Down to the cot on which you lie are tied.       Lie still, Beloved; that dead thing lying yonder,       I hated and I killed, but love is sweet,     And you are more than sweet to me, who love you,       Who decked my eyes with dust from off your feet.       Give me your lips; Ah, lovely and disloyal       Give me yourself again; before you go     Down through the darkness of the Great, Blind Portal,       All of life's best and basest you must know.       Erstwhile Beloved, you were so young and fragile       I held you gently, as one holds a flower:     But now, God knows, what use to still be tender       To one whose life is done within an hour?       I hurt?  What then?  Death will not hurt you, dearest,       As you hurt me, for just a single night,     You call me cruel, who laid my life in ruins       To gain one little moment of delight.       Look up, look out, across the open doorway       The sunlight streams.  The distant hills are blue.     Look at the pale, pink peach trees in our garden,       Sweet fruit will come of them; - but not for you.       The fair, far snow, upon those jagged mountains       That gnaw against the hard blue Afghan sky     Will soon descend, set free by summer sunshine.       You will not see those torrents sweeping by.       The world is not for you.  From this day forward,       You must lie still alone; who would not lie     Alone for one night only, though returning       I was, when earliest dawn should break the sky.       There lies my lute, and many strings are broken,       Some one was playing it, and some one tore     The silken tassels round my Hookah woven;       Some one who plays, and smokes, and loves, no more!       Some one who took last night his fill of pleasure,       As I took mine at dawn!  The knife went home     Straight through his heart!  God only knows my rapture       Bathing my chill hands in the warm red foam.       And so I pain you?  This is only loving,       Wait till I kill you!  Ah, this soft, curled hair!     Surely the fault was mine, to love and leave you       Even a single night, you are so fair.       Cold steel is very cooling to the fervour       Of over passionate ones, Beloved, like you.     Nay, turn your lips to mine.  Not quite unlovely       They are as yet, as yet, though quite untrue.       What will your brother say, to-night returning       With laden camels homewards to the hills,     Finding you dead, and me asleep beside you,       Will he awake me first before he kills?       For I shall sleep.  Here on the cot beside you       When you, my Heart's Delight, are cold in death.     When your young heart and restless lips are silent,       Grown chilly, even beneath my burning breath.       When I have slowly drawn my knife across you,       Taking my pleasure as I see you swoon,     I shall sleep sound, worn out by love's last fervour,       And then, God grant your kinsmen kill me soon!"
"Alas! alas! this wasted Night     With all its Jasmin-scented air,     Its thousand stars, serenely bright!     I lie alone, and long for you,     Long for your Champa-scented hair,     Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;       Long for the close-curved, delicate lips      - Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine -      Here, where the slender fountain drips,     Here, where the yellow roses glow,     Pale in the tender silver shine     The stars across the garden throw.       Alas! alas! poor passionate Youth!     Why must we spend these lonely nights?     The poets hardly speak the truth, -      Despite their praiseful litany,     His season is not all delights     Nor every night an ecstasy!       The very power and passion that make -      Might make - his days one golden dream,     How he must suffer for their sake!     Till, in their fierce and futile rage,     The baffled senses almost deem     They might be happier in old age.       Age that can find red roses sweet,     And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;     Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet     Of sweeter singers went his way;     Inhale warm breezes from the South,     Yet never fed his fancy stray.       From some near Village I can hear     The cadenced throbbing of a drum,     Now softly distant, now more near;     And in an almost human fashion,     It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come     Laden with sighs of fitful passion,       To mock me, lying here alone     Among the thousand useless flowers     Upon the fountain's border-stone -      Cold stone, that chills me as I lie     Counting the slowly passing hours     By the white spangles in the sky.       Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,     Where, close together, side by side,     Gay in their gauze and tinsel state     With lips serene and downcast eyes,     Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,     While round them songs and laughter rise.       They are together; Why are we     So hopelessly, so far apart?     Oh, I implore you, come to me!     Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!     Come Consolation of my heart!     Light of my senses!  What replies?       A little, languid, mocking breeze     That rustles through the Jasmin flowers     And stirs among the Tamarind trees;     A little gurgle of the spray     That drips, unheard, though silent hours,     Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.       Wind, have you never loved a rose?     And water, seek you not the Sea?     Why, therefore, mock at my repose?     Is it my fault I am alone     Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree     Whose shadows over me are thrown?       Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst     For all to me this night denied     And drunk with longing, and accurst     Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,     With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,     And dreams of beauty unpossessed.       Hating the hour that brings you not,     Mad at the space betwixt us twain,     Sad for my empty arms, so hot     And fevered, even the chilly stone     Can scarcely cool their burning pain, -      And oh, this sense of being alone!       Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,     You bring me not my Life's Delight,     My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!     You leave me loveless and forlorn,     Pass on, most false and futile night,     Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!"
"Along the hot and endless road,       Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,     The prisoner bore his fetters' load       Beneath the scorching, azure skies.       Serene and tall, with brows unbent,       Without a hope, without a friend,     He, under escort, onward went,       With death to meet him at the end.       The Poppy fields were pink and gay       On either side, and in the heat     Their drowsy scent exhaled all day       A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.       And when the cool of evening fell       And tender colours touched the sky,     He still felt youth within him dwell       And half forgot he had to die.       Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit       And casting fitful light around,     His guard would, friend-like, let him sit       And talk awhile with them, unbound.       Thus they, the night before the last,       Were resting, when a group of girls     Across the small encampment passed,       With laughing lips and scented curls.       Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes       A sudden light lit up once more,     The women saw him with surprise,       And pity for the chains he bore.       For little women reck of Crime       If young and fair the criminal be     Here in this tropic, amorous clime       Where love is still untamed and free.       And one there was, she walked less fast,       Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled     By his lithe form, who, as she passed,       Waited a little while, and smiled.       The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,       Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.     So tolerant of human passion,       ""To love he has but one more day.""       Yet when (the soft and scented gloom       Scarce lighted by the dying fire)     His arms caressed her youth and bloom,       With him it was not all desire.       ""For me,"" he whispered, as he lay,       ""But little life remains to live.     One thing I crave to take away:       You have the gift; but will you give?       ""If I could know some child of mine       Would live his life, and see the sun     Across these fields of poppies shine,       What should I care that mine is done?       ""To die would not be dying quite,       Leaving a little life behind,     You, were you kind to me to-night,       Could grant me this; but - are you kind?       ""See, I have something here for you       For you and It, if It there be.""     Soft in the gloom her glances grew,       With gentle tears he could not see.       He took the chain from off his neck,       Hid in the silver chain there lay     Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.       She answered softly ""I will stay.""       He drew her close; the moonless skies       Shed little light; the fire was dead.     Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,       And many tender things she said.       Throughout the hot and silent night       All that he asked of her she gave.     And, left alone ere morning light,       He went serenely to the grave,       Happy; for even when the rope       Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,     And centered round his Secret Hope       The little life that was to be.       When Poppies bloomed again, she bore       His child who gaily laughed and crowed,     While round his tiny neck he wore       The rubies given on the road.       For his small sake she wished to wait,       But vainly to forget she tried,     And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,       She broke her gentle heart and died."
"She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,           Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!     I, to have given you everything:           Beauty maddens the soul like Wine.       ""She is proud to have held aloof her charms,           Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!     But I, of the night you lay in my arms:           Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!       ""She triumphs to think that your heart is won,           Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!     I had not a thought of myself, not one:           Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!       ""She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,           Dear, deluded Lover of mine!     I would lose both body and soul for you:           Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!       ""While the ways are fair she will love you well,           Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!     But I would have followed you down to Hell:           Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!       ""Though you lay at her feet the days to be,           Now no longer Lover of mine!     You can give her naught that you gave not me:           Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!       ""When the years have shown what is false or true:           Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!     You will understand how I cared for you,           First and only Lover of mine!"""
"  Third Song, written during Fever       To-night the clouds hang very low,         They take the Hill-tops to their breast,         And lay their arms about the fields.     The wind that fans me lying low,         Restless with great desire for rest,         No cooling touch of freshness yields.       I, sleepless through the stifling heat,         Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow         Between the wide set open doors.     I lie and long amidst the heat, -          The fever that my senses know,         For that cool slenderness of yours.       So delicate and cool you are!         A roseleaf that has lain in snow,         A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.     You do not know, so young you are,         How Fever fans the senses' glow         To uncontrollable desire!       And fills the spaces of the night         With furious and frantic thought,         One would not dare to think by day.     Ah, if you came to me to-night         These visions would be turned to naught,         These hateful dreams be held at bay!       But you are far, and Loneliness         My only lover through the night;         And not for any word or prayer     Would you console my loneliness         Or lend yourself, serene and slight,         And the cool clusters of your hair.       All through the night I long for you,         As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn         For the fresh flow of streams and springs.     My fevered fancies follow you         As dying men in deserts turn         Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.       Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,         Unceasing and unsatisfied,         Until the night is burnt away     Among these dreams and fevered thirst,         And, through the open doorways, glide         The white feet of the coming day."
" Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman         Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.     This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly         Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.       And you lay silent, while his slender needles         Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,     Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,         That subtle union, whose child is charm.       Charm irresistible: the lovely something         We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.     The unattainable Divine Enchantment,         Hinted in music, never heard in speech.       This from the blue design exhales towards me,         As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,     While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,         Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;       Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure         Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white     Curve of the arm.  Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,         Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?  "
" Farewell, Aziz, it was not mine to fold you       Against my heart for any length of days.     I had no loveliness, alas, to hold you,       No siren voice, no charm that lovers praise.       Yet, in the midst of grief and desolation,       Solace I my despairing soul with this:     Once, for my life's eternal consolation,       You lent my lips your loveliness to kiss.       Ah, that one night!  I think Love's very essence       Distilled itself from out my joy and pain,     Like tropical trees, whose fervid inflorescence       Glows, gleams, and dies, never to bloom again.       Often I marvel how I met the morning       With living eyes after that night with you,     Ah, how I cursed the wan, white light for dawning,       And mourned the paling stars, as each withdrew!       Yet I, even I, who am less than dust before you,       Less than the lowest lintel of your door,     Was given one breathless midnight, to adore you.       Fate, having granted this, can give no more!"
" Just as the dawn of Love was breaking            Across the weary world of grey,     Just as my life once more was waking            As roses waken late in May,     Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,            Stepped in and carried you away.       Memories have I none in keeping            Of times I held you near my heart,     Of dreams when we were near to weeping            That dawn should bid us rise and part;     Never, alas, I saw you sleeping            With soft closed eyes and lips apart,       Breathing my name still through your dreaming. -             Ah! had you stayed, such things had been!     But Fate, unheeding human scheming,            Serenely reckless came between -      Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming            Unseared by all the sorrow seen.       Ah! well-beloved, I never told you,            I did not show in speech or song,     How at the end I longed to fold you            Close in my arms; so fierce and strong     The longing grew to have and hold you,            You, and you only, all life long.       They who know nothing call me fickle,            Keen to pursue and loth to keep.     Ah, could they see these tears that trickle            From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.     Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,            While pain and sorrow stand and reap!       Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie            The hopes that rose-like round me grew,     The lights are low, and more than lonely            This life I lead apart from you.     Come back, come back!  I want you only,            And you who loved me never knew.       You loved me, pleaded for compassion            On all the pain I would not share;     And I in weary, halting fashion            Was loth to listen, long to care;     But now, dear God! I faint with passion            For your far eyes and distant hair.       Yes, I am faint with love, and broken            With sleepless nights and empty days;     I want your soft words fiercely spoken,            Your tender looks and wayward ways -      Want that strange smile that gave me token            Of many things that no man says.       Cold was I, weary, slow to waken            Till, startled by your ardent eyes,     I felt the soul within me shaken            And long-forgotten senses rise;     But in that moment you were taken,            And thus we lost our Paradise!       Farewell, we may not now recover            That golden ""Then"" misspent, passed by,     We shall not meet as loved and lover            Here, or hereafter, you and I.     My time for loving you is over,            Love has no future, but to die.       And thus we part, with no believing            In any chance of future years.     We have no idle self-deceiving,            No half-consoling hopes and fears;     We know the Gods grant no retrieving            A wasted chance.  Fate knows no tears."
"  Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,     Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,     Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,     And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,                     Had I the power.       And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,     Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,     That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted     In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.                     Had I the power.       Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace     To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,     Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple, -      To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,                     Had I the power."
"He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,       Red oleanders twisted in His hair,     His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,       Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.       The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,       And from their filmy, iridescent scum     Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,       Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.       His messengers: They bear the deadly taint       On spangled wings aloft and far away,     Making thin music, strident and yet faint,       From golden eve to silver break of day.       The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine       Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest     The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,       Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.       While far away He in the marshes lies,       Staining the stagnant water with His breath,     An endless hunger burning in His eyes,       A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.       He hides among the ghostly mists that float       Over the water, weird and white and chill,     And peasants, passing in their laden boat,       Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.       A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,       Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,     Only increase the frenzy of His greed       To add more victims to th' already slain.       He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,       Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,     Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,       He sends them lovely dreams before they die;       Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,       Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,     To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,       Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest."
"The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above       The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,       No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.       Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,       And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,     My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew       That you will come to me before the night.       In the Verandah all the lights are lit,       And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,     Between the pillars flying foxes flit,       Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.       Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear       My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,     Break with delight, at last, to know you near.       Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.       I envy these: the steps that you will tread,       The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,     When, in your slender height, you stoop your head       At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.       For though you utterly belong to me,       And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,     Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be       That keen delight so much akin to pain.       The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,       And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above     Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,       There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.       Every time you give yourself to me,       The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,     This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be       A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.       And as the water, gurgling softly, goes       Among the piles beneath the slender floor;     I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,       Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.       The Miracle, that you should come to me,       Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,     It is as though some White Star stooped to be       The messmate of our little cooking fire.       Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,       And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,     And yet; - I look into your brilliant eyes,       And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.       Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,       The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,     And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,       So more than proud since you have found it fair.       My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink       Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice     Losing its life in yours! the lute I think       But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.       But you desired it, therefore I obey.       Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,     Whether it please you to caress or slay,       It would please me to give obedience still.       I would delight to die beneath your kiss;       I envy that young maiden who was slain,     So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,       Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain -        If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.       There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet     As is the pain endured for one adored;       If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet       I should be happy!  Ah, come soon, come soon,       See how the stars grow large and white above,     The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,       There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love."
"Against the planks of the cabin side,         (So slight a thing between them and me,)     The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,         The great green waves of the Indian sea!       Your face was white as the foam is white,         Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,     I would we had steamed and reached that night         The sea's last edge, the end of the world.       The wind blew in through the open port,         So freshly joyous and salt and free,     Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,         And then swept back to the open sea.       The engines throbbed with their constant beat;         Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;     Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,         While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.       So straight you lay in your narrow berth,         Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be     Essence of all that is sweet on earth,         Of all that is sad and strange at sea.       And you were white as the foam is white,         Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.     Ah! had we but sailed and reached that night,         The sea's last edge, the end of the world!"
"I hate this City, seated on the Plain,       The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,     Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,       This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.       The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,       Screening my happiness as evening fell.     It was well worth - that most Enchanted Night -        This life in torment, and the next in Hell!       People are kind to me; one More than Kind,       Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,     But kindness is a burden on my mind,       And it is weariness to hear her speak.       For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,       My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,     To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,       Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.       He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,       The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,     But since they fettered him I have no care       That my returning steps to health are slow.       They will not loose him till they know my fate,       And I rest here till I am strong to slay,     Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait       Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.       That cursed Kaffir! Well, he won by day,       But I won, what I so desired, by night,     My arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!       Also, the game is not yet over - quite!       Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth       To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,     To raze thy very Memory from the North,       So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!       Aha! Friend Amir Ali! it is Duty       To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,     They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,       Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!       Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,       Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.     Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;       Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!       Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure       To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,     And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,       Can dream of many ways a man may die.       I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,       Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;     Oh! shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,       This would torment me through Eternity!       Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,       Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,     And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,       And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.       Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind       That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.     Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,       Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!"
"""Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes     No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?       ""Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,     Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented.       ""Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,     What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?""       But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,     Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.       Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,     Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.       And she said, with smiles and blushes, ""Would that I had sooner known!     Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone.       ""Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,     I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"""
" The fires that burn on all the hills       Light up the landscape grey,     The arid desert land distills       The fervours of the day.       The clear white moon sails through the skies       And silvers all the night,     I see the brilliance of your eyes       And need no other light.       The death sighs of a thousand flowers       The fervent day has slain     Are wafted through the twilight hours,       And perfume all the plain.       My senses strain, and try to clasp       Their sweetness in the air,     In vain, in vain; they only grasp       The fragrance of your hair.       The plain is endless space expressed;       Vast is the sky above,     I only feel, against your breast,       Infinities of love."
"At Kotri, by the river, when the evening's sun is low,     The waving palm trees quiver, the golden waters glow,     The shining ripples shiver, descending to the sea;     At Kotri, by the river, she used to wait for me.       So young, she was, and slender, so pale with wistful eyes     As luminous and tender as Kotri's twilight skies.     Her face broke into flowers, red flowers at the mouth,     Her voice, - she sang for hours like bulbuls in the south.       We sat beside the water through burning summer days,     And many things I taught her of Life and all its ways     Of Love, man's loveliest duty, of Passion's reckless pain,     Of Youth, whose transient beauty comes once, but not again.       She lay and laughed and listened beside the water's edge.     The glancing river glistened and glinted through the sedge.     Green parrots flew above her and, as the daylight died,     Her young arms drew her lover more closely to her side.       Oh days so warm and golden! oh nights so cool and still!     When Love would not be holden, and Pleasure had his will.     Days, when in after leisure, content to rest we lay,     Nights, when her lips' soft pressure drained all my life away.       And while we sat together, beneath the Babul trees,     The fragrant, sultry weather cooled by the river breeze,     If passion faltered ever, and left the senses free,     We heard the tireless river decending to the sea.       I know not where she wandered, or went in after days,     Or if her youth she squandered in Love's more doubtful ways.     Perhaps, beside the river, she died, still young and fair;     Perchance the grasses quiver above her slumber there.       At Kotri, by the river, maybe I too shall sleep     The sleep that lasts for ever, too deep for dreams; too deep.     Maybe among the shingle and sand of floods to be     Her dust and mine may mingle and float away to sea.       Ah Kotri, by the river, when evening's sun is low,     Your faint reflections quiver, your golden ripples glow.     You knew, oh Kotri river, that love which could not last.     For me your palms still shiver with passions of the past."
"Kama the Indian Eros       The daylight is dying,     The Flying fox flying,           Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.     See, the sun throws a late,     Lingering, roseate           Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.       The time of our Trysting!     Oh, come, unresisting,           Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.     Shadow shall cover us,     Roses bend over us,           Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.       We know not life's reason,     The length of its season,           Know not if they know, the great Ones above.     We none of us sought it,     And few could support it,           Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.       But much is forgiven     To Gods who have given,           If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.     You do not yet know it,     But Kama shall show it,           Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.       The Fireflies shall light you,     And naught shall afright you,           Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.     Come, for I wait for you,     Night is too late for you,           Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.       Every breeze still is,     And, scented with lilies,           Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,     The garden lies breathless,     Where Kama, the Deathless,           In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you."
" A little breeze blew over the sea,         And it came from far away,     Across the fields of millet and rice,     All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,     It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,         As upon the deck he lay.       It said, ""Oh, idle upon the sea,         Awake and with sleep have done,     Haul up the widest sail of the prow,     And come with me to the rice fields now,     She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,         To show you your first-born son!"""
"How I loved you in your sleep,     With the starlight on your hair!       The touch of your lips was sweet,       Aziza whom I adore,     I lay at your slender feet,       And against their soft palms pressed,     I fitted my face to rest.     As winds blow over the sea       From Citron gardens ashore,     Came, through your scented hair,       The breeze of the night to me.       My lips grew arid and dry,       My nerves were tense,     Though your beauty soothe the eye       It maddens the sense.     Every curve of that beauty is known to me,     Every tint of that delicate roseleaf skin,       And these are printed on every atom of me,     Burnt in on every fibre until I die.       And for this, my sin,     I doubt if ever, though dust I be,     The dust will lose the desire,     The torment and hidden fire,     Of my passionate love for you.       Aziza whom I adore,     My dust will be full of your beauty, as is the blue     And infinite ocean full of the azure sky.       In the light that waxed and waned     Playing about your slumber in silver bars,     As the palm trees swung their feathery fronds athwart the stars,     How quiet and young you were,     Pale as the Champa flowers, violet veined,     That, sweet and fading, lay in your loosened hair.       How sweet you were in your sleep,     With the starlight on your hair!     Your throat thrown backwards, bare,     And touched with circling moonbeams, silver white       On the couch's sombre shade.     O Aziza my one delight,     When Youth's passionate pulses fade,     And his golden heart beats slow,     When across the infinite sky     I see the roseate glow     Of my last, last sunset flare,     I shall send my thoughts to this night     And remember you as I die,     The one thing, among all the things of this earth, found fair.       How sweet you were in your sleep,     With the starlight, silver and sable, across your hair!"
"Why above others was I so blessed        And honoured? to be chosen one     To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,        As now I may hold your only son.       Twelve months ago; that wonderful night!        You gave your life to me in a kiss;     Have I done well, for that past delight,        In return, to have given you this?       Look down at his face, your face, beloved,        His eyes are azure as yours are blue.     In every line of his form is proved        How well I loved you, and only you.       I felt the secret hope at my heart        Turned suddenly to the living joy,     And knew that your life and mine had part        As golden grains in a brass alloy.       And learning thus, that your child was mine,        Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,     I held myself as a sacred shrine        Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,       That all unworthy I might not be        Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell     Hidden away in the heart of me,        As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.       Do you remember, when first you laid        Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?     My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,        You seemed so slender and strangely white.       I always tremble; the moments flew        Swiftly to dawn that took you away,     But this is a small and lovely you        Content to rest in my arms all day.       Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,        And given your only child to me,     My life devoted to yours and his,        Whilst I am living, will always be.       And after death, through the long To Be,        (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)     I, should you chance to have need of me,        Am ever and always, only yours."
"We have left Gul Kach behind us,        Are marching on Apozai, -      Where pleasure and rest are waiting        To welcome us by and by.       We're falling back from the Gomal,        Across the Gir-dao plain,     The camping ground is deserted,        We'll never come back again.       Along the rocks and the defiles,        The mules and the camels wind.     Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,        The man who is left behind.       For some we lost in the skirmish,        And some were killed in the fight,     But he was captured by fever,        In the sentry pit, at night.       A rifle shot had been swifter,        Less trouble a sabre thrust,     But his Fate decided fever,        And each man dies as he must.       Behind us, red in the distance.        The wavering flames rise high,     The flames of our burning grass-huts,        Against the black of the sky.       We hear the sound of the river,        An ever-lessening moan,     The hearts of us all turn backwards        To where he is left alone.       We sing up a little louder,        We know that we feel bereft,     We're leaving the camp together,        And only one of us left.       The only one, out of many,        And each must come to his end,     I wish I could stop this singing,        He happened to be my friend.       We're falling back from the Gomal        We're marching on Apozai,     And pleasure and rest are waiting        To welcome us by and by.       Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,        The lips of the girls less kind, -      Because of Rahimut-Ullah,        The man who is left behind!"
"Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan                                Throb, throb, throb,     Far away in the blue transparent Night,     On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,     She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat                 Afar, afloat     On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;        Hear the sound of the straining wood            Like a broken sob            Of a heart's distress,        Loving misunderstood.       She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,     On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,     Every cell of her brain is latent fire,     Every fibre tense with restrained desire.            And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,            The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;          ""How to wait through the moments' space          Till I see the light of my lover's face?""                                Throb, throb, throb,     The sound dies down the stream     Till it only clings at the senses' edge     Like a half-remembered dream.           Doubtless, he in the silence lies,           His fair face turned to the tender skies,           Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.     While his boat caught in the thickset sedge     And the waters round it gurgle and sob,           Or floats set free on the river's tide,                                    Oars laid aside.       She is awake and knows no rest,     Passion dies and is dispossessed            Of his brief, despotic power.     But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire     Were the whole world pasture to its desire,     And all of love, in a single hour, -      A single wine cup, filled to the brim,                                Given to slake its thirst.       Some there are who are thus-wise cursed           Times that follow fulfilled desire           Are of all their hours the worst.     They find no Respite and reach no Rest,     Though passion fail and desire grow dim,           No assuagement comes from the thing possessed                        For possession feeds the fire.            ""Oh, for the life of the bright hued things            Whose marriage and death are one,          A floating fusion on golden wings.            Alit with passion and sun!            ""But we who re-marry a thousand times,            As the spirit or senses will,          In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,            We remain unsatisfied still.""       As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,     With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.     She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,     Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.     Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,     And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.     While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on     Till the light of another day, serene and wan,                                Pierces the eastern skies."
"You are all that is lovely and light,       Aziza whom I adore,     And, waking, after the night,       I am weary with dreams of you.     Every nerve in my heart is tense and sore       As I rise to another morning apart from you.       I dream of your luminous eyes,       Aziza whom I adore!     Of the ruffled silk of your hair,     I dream, and the dreams are lies.     But I love them, knowing no more       Will ever be mine of you     Aziza, my life's despair.       I would burn for a thousand days,     Aziza whom I adore,     Be tortured, slain, in unheard of ways       If you pitied the pain I bore.     You pity!  Your bright eyes, fastened on other things,     Are keener to sting my soul, than scorpion stings!       You are all that is lovely to me,       All that is light,     One white rose in a Desert of weariness.       I only live in the night,     The night, with its fair false dreams of you,       You and your loveliness.               Give me your love for a day,               A night, an hour:             If the wages of sin are Death               I am willing to pay.       What is my life but a breath         Of passion burning away?       Away for an unplucked flower.         O Aziza whom I adore,       Aziza my one delight,         Only one night, I will die before day,       And trouble your life no more."
" Do you ever think of me? you who died         Ere our Youth's first fervour chilled,     With your soft eyes and your pulses stilled         Lying alone, aside,     Do you ever think of me, left in the light,     From the endless calm of your dawnless night?       I am faithful always: I do not say         That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old     To lesser kisses are always cold;         Had you wished for this in its narrow sense         Our love perhaps had been less intense;     But as we held faithfulness, you and I,         I am faithful always, as you who lie,         Asleep for ever, beneath the grass,         While the days and nights and the seasons pass, -              Pass away.       I keep your memory near my heart,         My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star,     Till long live over, I too depart         To the infinite night where perhaps you are.       Oh, are you anywhere?  Loved so well!     I would rather know you alive in Hell     Than think your beauty is nothing now,     With its deep dark eyes and tranquil brow     Where the hair fell softly.  Can this be true     That nothing, nowhere, exists of you?     Nothing, nowhere, oh, loved so well         I have never forgotten.                          Do you still keep     Thoughts of me through your dreamless sleep?       Oh, gone from me! lost in Eternal Night,         Lost Star of light,     Risen splendidly, set so soon,         Through the weariness of life's afternoon               I dream of your memory yet.     My loved and lost, whom I could not save,     My youth went down with you to the grave,     Though other planets and stars may rise,     I dream of your soft and sorrowful eyes             And I cannot forget.  "
"I have no wit, I have no words, no tears;  My heart within me like a stone  Is numbed too much for hopes or fears;  Look right, look left, I dwell alone;  A lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief  No everlasting hills I see;  My life is like the falling leaf;  O Jesus, quicken me."
" What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful?  It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?    I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is what I want.    When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking    'Is this the one I am too appear for,  Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?    Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,  Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.      Is this the one for the annunciation?  My god, what a laugh!'    But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me.    I would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button.      I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year.    After all I am alive only by accident.      I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way.    Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,    The diaphanous satins of a January window  White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath.   O ivory!    It must be a tusk there, a ghost column.    Can you not see I do not mind what it is.      Can you not give it to me?  Do not be ashamed--I do not mind if it is small.      Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity.    Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,    The glaze, the mirrory variety of it.    Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.      I know why you will not give it to me,  You are terrified    The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,  Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,    A marvel to your great-grandchildren.    Do not be afraid, it is not so.      I will only take it and go aside quietly.    You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,    No falling ribbons, no scream at the end.    I do not think you credit me with this discretion.      If you only knew how the veils were killing my days.    To you they are only transparencies, clear air.      But my god, the clouds are like cotton.    Armies of them.   They are carbon monoxide.      Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in,  Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million    Probable motes that tick the years off my life.    You are silver-suited for the occasion.   O adding machine-----    Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?  Must you stamp each piece purple,    Must you kill what you can?  There is one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.      It stands at my window, big as the sky.    It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center    Where split lives congeal and stiffen to history.    Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.      Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty  By the time the whole of it was delivered, and to numb to use it.      Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil.    If it were death    I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes.    I would know you were serious.      There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday.    And the knife not carve, but enter    Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,  And the universe slide from my side.  "
" In the dour ages  Of drafty cells and draftier castles,  Of dragons breathing without the frame of fables,  Saint and king unfisted obstruction's knuckles  By no miracle or majestic means,    But by such abuses  As smack of spite and the overscrupulous  Twisting of thumbscrews: one soul tied in sinews,  One white horse drowned, and all the unconquered pinnacles  Of God's city and Babylon's    Must wait, while here Suso's  Hand hones his tack and needles,  Scouraging to sores his own red sluices  For the relish of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles  Of horsehair and lice his horny loins;  While there irate Cyrus  Squanders a summer and the brawn of his heroes  To rebuke the horse-swallowing River Gyndes:  He split it into three hundred and sixty trickles  A girl could wade without wetting her shins.      Still, latter-day sages,  Smiling at this behavior, subjugating their enemies  Neatly, nicely, by disbelief or bridges,  Never grip, as the grandsires did, that devil who chuckles  From grain of the marrow and the river-bed grains."
" Touch it: it won't shrink like an eyeball,  This egg-shaped bailiwick, clear as a tear.    Here's yesterday, last year ---  Palm-spear and lily distinct as flora in the vast  Windless threadwork of a tapestry.      Flick the glass with your fingernail:  It will ping like a Chinese chime in the slightest air stir  Though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer.    The inhabitants are light as cork,  Every one of them permanently busy.      At their feet, the sea waves bow in single file.    Never trespassing in bad temper:  Stalling in midair,   Short-reined, pawing like paradeground horses.    Overhead, the clouds sit tasseled and fancy    As Victorian cushions.   This family  Of valentine faces might please a collector:  They ring true, like good china.      Elsewhere the landscape is more frank.    The light falls without letup, blindingly.      A woman is dragging her shadow in a circle  About a bald hospital saucer.    It resembles the moon, or a sheet of blank paper  And appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg.    She lives quietly    With no attachments, like a foetus in a bottle,  The obsolete house, the sea, flattened to a picture  She has one too many dimensions to enter.    Grief and anger, exorcised,  Leave her alone now.      The future is a grey seagull  Tattling in its cat-voice of departure.    Age and terror, like nurses, attend her,  And a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,  Crawls up out of the sea."
"Compelled by calamity's magnet  They loiter and stare as if the house  Burnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought  Some scandal might any minute ooze  From a smoke-choked closet into light;  No deaths, no prodigious injuries  Glut these hunters after an old meat,  Blood-spoor of the austere tragedies.      Mother Medea in a green smock  Moves humbly as any housewife through  Her ruined apartments, taking stock  Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery:  Cheated of the pyre and the rack,  The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away."
"Spry, wry, and gray as these March sticks,  Percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi.    He is recuperating from something on the lung.      The narcissi, too, are bowing to some big thing :  It rattles their stars on the green hill where Percy  Nurses the hardship of his stitches, and walks and walks.      There is a dignity to this; there is a formality --  The flowers vivid as bandages, and the man mending.    They bow and stand : they suffer such attacks!    And the octogenarian loves the little flocks.    He is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing.    The narcissi look up like children, quickly and whitely."
"The smile of iceboxes annihilates me.    Such blue currents in the veins of my loved one!  I hear her great heart purr.      From her lips ampersands and percent signs  Exit like kisses.    It is Monday in her mind: morals    Launder and present themselves.    What am I to make of these contradictions?  I wear white cuffs, I bow.      Is this love then, this red material  Issuing from the steele needle that flies so blindingly?  It will make little dresses and coats,    It will cover a dynasty.    How her body opens and shuts --  A Swiss watch, jeweled in the hinges!    O heart, such disorganization!  The stars are flashing like terrible numerals.    ABC, her eyelids say."
" There is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself --  Infinite, green, utterly untouchable.    Angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also.    They are my medium.    The sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights.      A grey wall now, clawed and bloody.    Is there no way out of the mind?  Steps at my back spiral into a well.    There are no trees or birds in this world,  There is only sourness.      This red wall winces continually:  A red fist, opening and closing,  Two grey, papery bags --  This is what i am made of, this, and a terror  Of being wheeled off under crosses and rain of pieties.      On a black wall, unidentifiable birds  Swivel their heads and cry.    There is no talk of immorality amoun these!  Cold blanks approach us:  They move in a hurry.  "
the slime of all my yesterdays  rots in the hollow of my skull    and if my stomach would contract  because of some explicable phenomenon  such as pregnancy or constipation    I would not remember you    or that because of sleep  infrequent as a moon of greencheese  that because of food  nourishing as violet leaves  that because of these    and in a few fatal yards of grass  in a few spaces of sky and treetops    a future was lost yesterday  as easily and irretrievably  as a tennis ball at twilight
" Since Christmas they have lived with us,  Guileless and clear,  Oval soul-animals,  Taking up half the space,  Moving and rubbing on the silk    Invisible air drifts,  Giving a shriek and pop  When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.    Yellow cathead, blue fish ----  Such queer moons we live with    Instead of dead furniture!  Straw mats, white walls  And these traveling  Globes of thin air, red, green,  Delighting    The heart like wishes or free  Peacocks blessing  Old ground with a feather  Beaten in starry metals.    Your small    Brother is making  His balloon squeak like a cat.    Seeming to see  A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,  He bites,    Then sits  Back, fat jug  Contemplating a world clear as water.    A red  Shred in his little fist."
" On the stiff twig up there  Hunches a wet black rook  Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain.    I do not expect a miracle  Or an accident    To set the sight on fire  In my eye, nor seek  Any more in the desultory weather some design,  But let spotted leaves fall as they fall,  Without ceremony, or portent.      Although, I admit, I desire,  Occasionally, some backtalk  From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:  A certain minor light may still  Lean incandescent    Out of kitchen table or chair  As if a celestial burning took  Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then --  Thus hallowing an interval  Otherwise inconsequent    By bestowing largesse, honor,  One might say love.   At any rate, I now walk  Wary (for it could happen  Even in this dull, ruinous landscape); skeptical,  Yet politic; ignorant    Of whatever angel may choose to flare  Suddenly at my elbow.   I only know that a rook  Ordering its black feathers can so shine  As to seize my senses, haul  My eyelids up, and grant    A brief respite from fear  Of total neutrality.   With luck,  Trekking stubborn through this season  Of fatigue, I shall  Patch together a content    Of sorts.   Miracles occur,  If you care to call those spasmodic  Tricks of radiance miracles.   The wait's begun again,  The long wait for the angel,  For that rare, random descent."
" Mayday: two came to field in such wise :  `A daisied mead', each said to each,  So were they one; so sought they couch,  Across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows.      `No pitchforked farmer, please,' she said;  `May cockcrow guard us safe,' said he;  By blackthorn thicket, flower spray  They pitched their coats, come to green bed.      Below: a fen where water stood;  Aslant: their hill of stinging nettle;  Then, honor-bound, mute grazing cattle;  Above: leaf-wraithed white air, white cloud.      All afternoon these lovers lay  Until the sun turned pale from warm,  Until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm :  Cruel nettles stung her angles raw.      Rueful, most vexed, that tender skin  Should accept so fell a wound,  He stamped and cracked stalks to the ground  Which had caused his dear girl pain.      Now he goes from his rightful road  And, under honor, will depart;  While she stands burning, venom-girt,  In wait for sharper smart to fade."
" This is winter, this is night, small love --  A sort of black horsehair,  A rough, dumb country stuff  Steeled with the sheen  Of what green stars can make it to our gate.    I hold you on my arm.    It is very late.    The dull bells tongue the hour.    The mirror floats us at one candle power.      This is the fluid in which we meet each other,  This haloey radiance that seems to breathe  And lets our shadows wither  Only to blow  Them huge again, violent giants on the wall.    One match scratch makes you real.      At first the candle will not bloom at all --  It snuffs its bud  To almost nothing, to a dull blue dud.      I hold my breath until you creak to life,  Balled hedgehog,  Small and cross.   The yellow knife  Grows tall.   You clutch your bars.    My singing makes you roar.    I rock you like a boat  Across the Indian carpet, the cold floor,  While the brass man  Kneels, back bent, as best he can    Hefting his white pillar with the light  That keeps the sky at bay,  The sack of black! It is everywhere, tight, tight!  He is yours, the little brassy Atlas --  Poor heirloom, all you have,  At his heels a pile of five brass cannonballs,  No child, no wife.    Five balls! Five bright brass balls!  To juggle with, my love, when the sky falls."
"Your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing.    I want to fill it with color and ducks,  The zoo of the new    Whose name you meditate --  April snowdrop, Indian pipe,  Little    Stalk without wrinkle,  Pool in which images  Should be grand and classical    Not this troublous  Wringing of hands, this dark  Ceiling without a star."
"Color floods to the spot, dull purple.    The rest of the body is all washed-out,  The color of pearl.      In a pit of a rock  The sea sucks obsessively,  One hollow thw whole sea's pivot.      The size of a fly,  The doom mark  Crawls down the wall.      The heart shuts,  The sea slides back,  The mirrors are sheeted."
"Through portico of my elegant house you stalk  With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit  And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net  Of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back.    Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak  Above the appalling ruin; in bleak light  Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight  Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break.      Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock;  While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit  Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot,  Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic:  Which such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,  What ceremony of words can patch the havoc?"
"Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.    Where do the black trees go that drink here?  Their shadows must cover Canada.      A little light is filtering from the water flowers.    Their leaves do not wish us to hurry:  They are round and flat and full of dark advice.      Cold worlds shake from the oar.    The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.    A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;    Stars open among the lilies.    Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?  This is the silence of astounded souls.  "
"But I would rather be horizontal.    I am not a tree with my root in the soil  Sucking up minerals and motherly love  So that each March I may gleam into leaf,  Nor am I the beauty of a garden bed  Attracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted,  Unknowing I must soon unpetal.    Compared with me, a tree is immortal  And a flower-head not tall, but more startling,  And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring.      Tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,  The trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors.    I walk among them, but none of them are noticing.    Sometimes I think that when I am sleeping  I must most perfectly resemble them--  Thoughts gone dim.    It is more natural to me, lying down.    Then the sky and I are in open conversation,  And I shall be useful when I lie down finally:  The the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me."
" Pocket watch, I tick well.    The streets are lizardly crevices  Sheer-sided, with holes where to hide.    It is best to meet in a cul-de-sac,    A palace of velvet  With windows of mirrors.    There one is safe,  There are no family photographs,    No rings through the nose, no cries.    Bright fish hooks, the smiles of women  Gulp at my bulk  And I, in my snazzy blacks,    Mill a litter of breasts like jellyfish.    To nourish  The cellos of moans I eat eggs --  Eggs and fish, the essentials,    The aphrodisiac squid.    My mouth sags,  The mouth of Christ  When my engine reaches the end of it.      The tattle of my  Gold joints, my way of turning  Bitches to ripples of silver  Rolls out a carpet, a hush.      And there is no end, no end of it.    I shall never grow old.   New oysters  Shriek in the sea and I  Glitter like Fontainebleu    Gratified,  All the fall of water an eye  Over whose pool I tenderly  Lean and see me.  "
"In my dream,   drilling into the marrow   of my entire bone,   my real dream,   I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill   searching for a street sign --   namely Mercy Street.     Not there.       I try the Back Bay.     Not there.     Not there.     And yet I know the number.     45 Mercy Street.     I know the stained-glass window   of the foyer,   the three flights of the house   with its parquet floors.     I know the furniture and   mother, grandmother, great-grandmother,   the servants.     I know the cupboard of Spode   the boat of ice, solid silver,   where the butter sits in neat squares   like strange giant's teeth   on the big mahogany table.     I know it well.     Not there.       Where did you go?   45 Mercy Street,   with great-grandmother   kneeling in her whale-bone corset   and praying gently but fiercely   to the wash basin,   at five A.M.     at noon   dozing in her wiggy rocker,   grandfather taking a nap in the pantry,   grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid,   and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower   on her forehead to cover the curl   of when she was good and when she was...     And where she was begat   and in a generation   the third she will beget,   me,   with the stranger's seed blooming   into the flower called Horrid.       I walk in a yellow dress   and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes,   enough pills, my wallet, my keys,   and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five?   I walk.   I walk.     I hold matches at street signs   for it is dark,   as dark as the leathery dead   and I have lost my green Ford,   my house in the suburbs,   two little kids   sucked up like pollen by the bee in me   and a husband   who has wiped off his eyes   in order not to see my inside out   and I am walking and looking   and this is no dream   just my oily life   where the people are alibis   and the street is unfindable for an   entire lifetime.       Pull the shades down --   I don't care!   Bolt the door, mercy,   erase the number,   rip down the street sign,   what can it matter,   what can it matter to this cheapskate   who wants to own the past   that went out on a dead ship   and left me only with paper?     Not there.     I open my pocketbook,   as women do,   and fish swim back and forth   between the dollars and the lipstick.     I pick them out,   one by one   and throw them at the street signs,   and shoot my pocketbook   into the Charles River.     Next I pull the dream off   and slam into the cement wall   of the clumsy calendar   I live in,   my life,   and its hauled up   notebooks."
"Oh, love, why do we argue like this?  I am tired of all your pious talk.    Also, I am tired of all the dead.    They refuse to listen,  so leave them alone.    Take your foot out of the graveyard,  they are busy being dead.      Everyone was always to blame:  the last empty fifth of booze,  the rusty nails and chicken feathers  that stuck in the mud on the back doorstep,  the worms that lived under the cat's ear  and the thin-lipped preacher  who refused to call  except once on a flea-ridden day  when he came scuffing in through the yard  looking for a scapegoat.    I hid in the kitchen under the ragbag.      I refuse to remember the dead.    And the dead are bored with the whole thing.    But you -- you go ahead,  go on, go on back down  into the graveyard,  lie down where you think their faces are;  talk back to your old bad dreams."
" Until tonight they were separate specialties,   different stories, the best of their own worst.     Riding my warm cabin home, I remember Betsy's   laughter; she laughed as you did, Rose, at the first   story.   Someday, I promised her, I'll be someone   going somewhere and we plotted it in the humdrum   school for proper girls.   The next April the plane   bucked me like a horse, my elevators turned   and fear blew down my throat, that last profane   gauge of a stomach coming up.   And then returned   to land, as unlovely as any seasick sailor,   sincerely eighteen; my first story, my funny failure.     Maybe Rose, there is always another story,   better unsaid, grim or flat or predatory.     Half a mile down the lights of the in-between cities   turn up their eyes at me.  And I remember Betsy's   story, the April night of the civilian air crash   and her sudden name misspelled in the evening paper,   the interior of shock and the paper gone in the trash   ten years now.   She used the return ticket I gave her.     This was the rude kill of her; two planes cracking   in mid-air over Washington, like blind birds.     And the picking up afterwards, the morticians tracking   bodies in the Potomac and piecing them like boards   to make a leg or a face.   There is only her miniature   photograph left, too long now for fear to remember.     Special tonight because I made her into a story   that I grew to know and savor.     A reason to worry,   Rose, when you fix an old death like that,   and outliving the impact, to find you've pretended.     We bank over Boston.   I am safe.   I put on my hat.     I am almost someone going home.   The story has ended."
" Watch out for power,   for its avalanche can bury you,   snow, snow, snow, smothering your mountain.       Watch out for hate,   it can open its mouth and youâ€™ll fling yourself out   to eat off your leg, an instant leper.       Watch out for friends,   because when you betray them,   as you will,   they will bury their heads in the toilet   and flush themselves away.       Watch out for intellect,   because it knows so much it knows nothing   and leaves you hanging upside down,   mouthing knowledge as your heart   falls out of your mouth.       Watch out for games, the actorâ€™s part,   the speech planned, known, given,   for they will give you away   and you will stand like a naked little boy,   pissing on your own child-bed.       Watch out for love   (unless it is true,   and every part of you says yes including the toes),   it will wrap you up like a mummy,   and your scream wonâ€™t be heard   and none of your running will end.       Love? Be it man.   Be it woman.     It must be a wave you want to glide in on,   give your body to it, give your laugh to it,   give, when the gravelly sand takes you,   your tears to the land.   To love another is something   like prayer and canâ€™t be planned, you just fall   into its arms because your belief undoes your disbelief.       Special person,   if I were you Iâ€™d pay no attention   to admonitions from me,   made somewhat out of your words   and somewhat out of mine.     A collaboration.     I do not believe a word I have said,   except some, except I think of you like a young tree   with pasted-on leaves and know youâ€™ll root   and the real green thing will come.       Let go.   Let go.     Oh special person,   possible leaves,   this typewriter likes you on the way to them,   but wants to break crystal glasses   in celebration,   for you,   when the dark crust is thrown off   and you float all around   like a happened balloon.  "
"Anger,   as black as a hook,   overtakes me.     Each day,   each Nazi  took, at 8:00 A.  M.  , a baby  and sauteed him for breakfast  in his frying pan.       And death looks on with a casual eye  and picks at the dirt under his fingernail.       Man is evil,  I say aloud.    Man is a flower  that should be burnt,  I say aloud.    Man  is a bird full of mud,  I say aloud.       And death looks on with a casual eye  and scratches his anus.       Man with his small pink toes,  with his miraculous fingers  is not a temple  but an outhouse,  I say aloud.    Let man never again raise his teacup.    Let man never again write a book.    Let man never again put on his shoe.    Let man never again raise his eyes,  on a soft July night.    Never.   Never.   Never.   Never.   Never.    I say those things aloud."
"You said the anger would come back   just as the love did.      I have a black look I do not   like.   It is a mask I try on.     I migrate toward it and its frog   sits on my lips and defecates.     It is old.   It is also a pauper.     I have tried to keep it on a diet.     I give it no unction.       There is a good look that I wear   like a blood clot.   I have   sewn it over my left breast.     I have made a vocation of it.     Lust has taken plant in it   and I have placed you and your   child at its milk tip.       Oh the blackness is murderous   and the milk tip is brimming   and each machine is working   and I will kiss you when   I cut up one dozen new men   and you will die somewhat,   again and again."
"Father, this year's jinx rides us apart   where you followed our mother to her cold slumber;   a second shock boiling its stone to your heart,  leaving me here to shuffle and disencumber  you from the residence you could not afford:  a gold key, your half of a woolen mill,  twenty suits from Dunne's, an English Ford,  the love and legal verbiage of another will,   boxes of pictures of people I do not know.     I touch their cardboard faces.   They must go.       But the eyes, as thick as wood in this album,  hold me.   I stop here, where a small boy  waits in a ruffled dress for someone to come...    for this soldier who holds his bugle like a toy   or for this velvet lady who cannot smile.    Is this your father's father, this Commodore   in a mailman suit? My father, time meanwhile  has made it unimportant who you are looking for.     I'll never know what these faces are all about.     I lock them into their book and throw them out.       Tlis is the yellow scrapbook that you began  the year I was born; as crackling now and wrinkly  as tobacco leaves: clippings where Hoover outran   the Democrats, wiggling his dry finger at me   and Prohibition; news where the Hindenburg went   down and recent years where you went flush   on war.   This year, solvent but sick, you meant  to marry that pretty widow in a one-month rush.     But before you had that second chance, I cried   on your fat shoulder.   Three days later you died.       These are the snapshots of marriage, stopped in places.     Side by side at the rail toward Nassau now;   here, with the winner's cup at the speedboat races,   here, in tails at the Cotillion, you take a bow,      here, by our kennel of dogs with their pink eyes,   running like show-bred pigs in their chain-link pen;   here, at the horseshow where my sister wins a prize;   Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator,   my first lost keeper, to love or look at later.        I hold a five-year diary that my mother kept   for three years, telling all she does not say   of your alcoholic tendency.   You overslept,   she writes.   My God, father, each Christmas Day   with your blood, will I drink down your glass   of wine? The diary of your hurly-burly years   goes to my shelf to wait for my age to pass.     Only in this hoarded span will love persevere.     Whether you are pretty or not, I outlive you,   bend down my strange face to yours and forgive you."
" A born salesman,  my father made all his dough  by selling wool to Fieldcrest, Woolrich and Faribo.      A born talker,  he could sell one hundred wet-down bales  of that white stuff.   He could clock the miles and the sales    and make it pay.    At home each sentence he would utter  had first pleased the buyer who'd paid him off in butter.      Each word  had been tried over and over, at any rate,  on the man who was sold by the man who filled my plate.      My father hovered  over the Yorkshire pudding and the beef:  a peddler, a hawker, a merchant and an Indian chief.      Roosevelt! Willkie! and war!  How suddenly gauche I was  with my old-maid heart and my funny teenage applause.      Each night at home  my father was in love with maps  while the radio fought its battles with Nazis and Japs.      Except when he hid  in his bedroom on a three-day drunk,  he typed out complex itineraries, packed his trunk,    his matched luggage  and pocketed a confirmed reservation,  his heart already pushing over the red routes of the nation.      I sit at my desk  each night with no place to go,  opening thee wrinkled maps of Milwaukee and Buffalo,    the whole U.S.,  its cemeteries, its arbitrary time zones,  through routes like small veins, capitals like small stones.      He died on the road,  his heart pushed from neck to back,  his white hanky signaling from the window of the Cadillac.      My husband,  as blue-eyed as a picture book, sells wool:  boxes of card waste, laps and rovings he can pull    to the thread  and say Leicester, Rambouillet, Merino,  a half-blood, it's greasy and thick, yellow as old snow.      And when you drive off, my darling,  Yes, sir! Yes, sir! It's one for my dame,  your sample cases branded with my father's name,    your itinerary open,  its tolls ticking and greedy,  its highways built up like new loves, raw and speedy."
"Anna who was mad,  I have a knife in my armpit.    When I stand on tiptoe I tap out messages.    Am I some sort of infection?  Did I make you go insane?  Did I make the sounds go sour?  Did I tell you to climb out the window?  Forgive.   Forgive.    Say not I did.    Say not.    Say.      Speak Mary-words into our pillow.    Take me the gangling twelve-year-old  into your sunken lap.    Whisper like a buttercup.    Eat me.   Eat me up like cream pudding.    Take me in.    Take me.    Take.      Give me a report on the condition of my soul.    Give me a complete statement of my actions.    Hand me a jack-in-the-pulpit and let me listen in.    Put me in the stirrups and bring a tour group through.    Number my sins on the grocery list and let me buy.    Did I make you go insane?  Did I turn up your earphone and let a siren drive through?  Did I open the door for the mustached psychiatrist  who dragged you out like a gold cart?  Did I make you go insane?  From the grave write me, Anna!  You are nothing but ashes but nevertheless  pick up the Parker Pen I gave you.    Write me.    Write."
"Earth, earth,  riding your merry-go-round  toward extinction,  right to the roots,  thickening the oceans like gravy,  festering in your caves,  you are becoming a latrine.    Your trees are twisted chairs.    Your flowers moan at their mirrors,  and cry for a sun that doesn't wear a mask.      Your clouds wear white,  trying to become nuns  and say novenas to the sky.    The sky is yellow with its jaundice,  and its veins spill into the rivers  where the fish kneel down  to swallow hair and goat's eyes.      All in all, I'd say,  the world is strangling.    And I, in my bed each night,  listen to my twenty shoes  converse about it.    And the moon,  under its dark hood,  falls out of the sky each night,  with its hungry red mouth  to suck at my scars."
"Good for visiting hospitals or charitable work.   Take some time to attend to your health.      Surely I will be disquieted  by the hospital, that body zone--  bodies wrapped in elastic bands,  bodies cased in wood or used like telephones,  bodies crucified up onto their crutches,  bodies wearing rubber bags between their legs,  bodies vomiting up their juice like detergent, Here in this house  there are other bodies.    Whenever I see a six-year-old  swimming in our aqua pool  a voice inside me says what can't be told.  .  .    Ha, someday you'll be old and withered  and tubes will be in your nose  drinking up your dinner.    Someday you'll go backward.   You'll close  up like a shoebox and you'll be cursed  as you push into death feet first.      Here in the hospital, I say,  that is not my body, not my body.    I am not here for the doctors  to read like a recipe.    No.   I am a daisy girl  blowing in the wind like a piece of sun.    On ward 7 there are daisies, all butter and pearl  but beside a blind man who can only  eat up the petals and count to ten.    The nurses skip rope around him and shiver  as his eyes wiggle like mercury and then  they dance from patient to patient to patient  throwing up little paper medicine cups and playing  catch with vials of dope as they wait for new accidents.    Bodies made of synthetics.   Bodies swaddled like dolls  whom I visit and cajole and all they do is hum  like computers doing up our taxes, dollar by dollar.    Each body is in its bunker.   The surgeon applies his gum.    Each body is fitted quickly into its ice-cream pack  and then stitched up again for the long voyage  back."
" And do not be indiscreet or unconventional.   Play it safe.      Listen here.   I've never played it safe  in spite of what the critics say.    Ask my imaginary brother, that waif,  that childhood best friend who comes to play  dress-up and stick-up and jacks and Pick-Up-Sticks,  bike downtown, stick out tongues at the Catholics.      Or form a Piss Club where we all go  in the bushes and peek at each other's sex.    Pop-gunning the street lights like crows.    Not knowing what to do with funny Kotex  so wearing it in our school shoes.   Friend, friend,  spooking my lonely hours you were there, but pretend."
"It's in the heart of the grape  where that smile lies.    It's in the good-bye-bow in the hair  where that smile lies.    It's in the clerical collar of the dress  where that smile lies.    What smile?  The smile of my seventh year,  caught here in the painted photograph.      It's peeling now, age has got it,  a kind of cancer of the background  and also in the assorted features.    It's like a rotten flag  or a vegetable from the refrigerator,  pocked with mold.    I am aging without sound,  into darkness, darkness.      Anne,  who are you?    I open the vein  and my blood rings like roller skates.    I open the mouth  and my teeth are an angry army.    I open the eyes  and they go sick like dogs  with what they have seen.    I open the hair  and it falls apart like dust balls.    I open the dress  and I see a child bent on a toilet seat.    I crouch there, sitting dumbly  pushing the enemas out like ice cream,  letting the whole brown world  turn into sweets.      Anne,  who are you?    Merely a kid keeping alive."
"Loving me with my shows off  means loving my long brown legs,  sweet dears, as good as spoons;  and my feet, those two children  let out to play naked.   Intricate nubs,  my toes.   No longer bound.    And what's more, see toenails and  all ten stages, root by root.    All spirited and wild, this little  piggy went to market and this little piggy  stayed.   Long brown legs and long brown toes.    Further up, my darling, the woman  is calling her secrets, little houses,  little tongues that tell you.      There is no one else but us  in this house on the land spit.    The sea wears a bell in its navel.    And I'm your barefoot wench for a  whole week.   Do you care for salami?  No.   You'd rather not have a scotch?  No.   You don't really drink.   You do  drink me.   The gulls kill fish,  crying out like three-year-olds.    The surf's a narcotic, calling out,  I am, I am, I am   all night long.   Barefoot,  I drum up and down your back.    In the morning I run from door to door  of the cabin playing chase me.    Now you grab me by the ankles.    Now you work your way up the legs  and come to pierce me at my hunger mark"
" His awful skin   stretched out by some tradesman   is like my skin, here between my fingers,   a kind of webbing, a kind of frog.     Surely when first born my face was this tiny   and before I was born surely I could fly.     Not well, mind you, only a veil of skin   from my arms to my waist.     I flew at night, too.   Not to be seen   for if I were I'd be taken down.     In August perhaps as the trees rose to the stars   I have flown from leaf to leaf in the thick dark.     If you had caught me with your flashlight   you would have seen a pink corpse with wings,   out, out, from her mother's belly, all furry   and hoarse skimming over the houses, the armies.     That's why the dogs of your house sniff me.     They know I'm something to be caught   somewhere in the cemetery hanging upside down   like a misshapen udder."
"What can I do with this bayonet?  Make a rose bush of it?  Poke it into the moon?  Shave my legs with its silver?  Spear a goldfish?  No.   No.      It was made  in my dream  for you.    My eyes were closed.    I was curled fetally  and yet I held a bayonet  that was for the earth of your stomach.    The belly button singing its puzzle.    The intestines winding like alpine roads.    It was made to enter you  as you have entered me  and to cut the daylight into you  and let out your buried heartland,  to let out the spoon you have fed me with,  to let out the bird that said fuck you,  to carve him onto a sculpture until he is white  and I could put him on a shelf,  an object unthinking as a stone,  but with all the vibrations  of a crucifix."
"Consider  a girl who keeps slipping off,  arms limp as old carrots,  into the hypnotist's trance,  into a spirit world  speaking with the gift of tongues.    She is stuck in the time machine,  suddenly two years old sucking her thumb,  as inward as a snail,  learning to talk again.    She's on a voyage.    She is swimming further and further back,  up like a salmon,  struggling into her mother's pocketbook.    Little doll child,  come here to Papa.    Sit on my knee.    I have kisses for the back of your neck.    A penny for your thoughts, Princess.    I will hunt them like an emerald.      Come be my snooky  and I will give you a root.    That kind of voyage,  rank as a honeysuckle.    Once  a king had a christening  for his daughter Briar Rose  and because he had only twelve gold plates  he asked only twelve fairies  to the grand event.    The thirteenth fairy,  her fingers as long and thing as straws,  her eyes burnt by cigarettes,  her uterus an empty teacup,  arrived with an evil gift.    She made this prophecy:  The princess shall prick herself  on a spinning wheel in her fifteenth year  and then fall down dead.    Kaputt!  The court fell silent.    The king looked like Munch's Scream  Fairies' prophecies,  in times like those,  held water.    However the twelfth fairy  had a certain kind of eraser  and thus she mitigated the curse  changing that death  into a hundred-year sleep.      The king ordered every spinning wheel  exterminated and exorcised.    Briar Rose grew to be a goddess  and each night the king  bit the hem of her gown  to keep her safe.    He fastened the moon up  with a safety pin  to give her perpetual light  He forced every male in the court  to scour his tongue with Bab-o  lest they poison the air she dwelt in.    Thus she dwelt in his odor.    Rank as honeysuckle.      On her fifteenth birthday  she pricked her finger  on a charred spinning wheel  and the clocks stopped.    Yes indeed.   She went to sleep.    The king and queen went to sleep,  the courtiers, the flies on the wall.    The fire in the hearth grew still  and the roast meat stopped crackling.    The trees turned into metal  and the dog became china.    They all lay in a trance,  each a catatonic  stuck in a time machine.    Even the frogs were zombies.    Only a bunch of briar roses grew  forming a great wall of tacks  around the castle.    Many princes  tried to get through the brambles  for they had heard much of Briar Rose  but they had not scoured their tongues  so they were held by the thorns  and thus were crucified.    In due time  a hundred years passed  and a prince got through.    The briars parted as if for Moses  and the prince found the tableau intact.    He kissed Briar Rose  and she woke up crying:  Daddy! Daddy!  Presto! She's out of prison!  She married the prince  and all went well  except for the fear --  the fear of sleep.      Briar Rose  was an insomniac.  .  .    She could not nap  or lie in sleep  without the court chemist  mixing her some knock-out drops  and never in the prince's presence.    If if is to come, she said,  sleep must take me unawares  while I am laughing or dancing  so that I do not know that brutal place  where I lie down with cattle prods,  the hole in my cheek open.    Further, I must not dream  for when I do I see the table set  and a faltering crone at my place,  her eyes burnt by cigarettes  as she eats betrayal like a slice of meat.      I must not sleep  for while I'm asleep I'm ninety  and think I'm dying.    Death rattles in my throat  like a marble.    I wear tubes like earrings.    I lie as still as a bar of iron.    You can stick a needle  through my kneecap and I won't flinch.    I'm all shot up with Novocain.    This trance girl  is yours to do with.    You could lay her in a grave,  an awful package,  and shovel dirt on her face  and she'd never call back: Hello there!  But if you kissed her on the mouth  her eyes would spring open  and she'd call out: Daddy! Daddy!  Presto!  She's out of prison.      There was a theft.    That much I am told.    I was abandoned.    That much I know.    I was forced backward.    I was forced forward.    I was passed hand to hand  like a bowl of fruit.    Each night I am nailed into place  and forget who I am.    Daddy?  That's another kind of prison.    It's not the prince at all,  but my father  drunkeningly bends over my bed,  circling the abyss like a shark,  my father thick upon me  like some sleeping jellyfish.    What voyage is this, little girl?  This coming out of prison?  God help --  this life after death?"
"You are the roast beef I have purchased  and I stuff you with my very own onion.    You are a boat I have rented by the hour  and I steer you with my rage until you run aground.    You are a glass that I have paid to shatter  and I swallow the pieces down with my spit.    You are the grate I warm my trembling hands on,  searing the flesh until it's nice and juicy.    You stink like my Mama under your bra  and I vomit into your hand like a jackpot  its cold hard quarters.  "
"Oh sharp diamond, my mother!   I could not count the cost   of all your faces, your moods--   that present that I lost.     Sweet girl, my deathbed,   my jewel-fingered lady,   your portrait flickered all night   by the bulbs of the tree.     Your face as calm as the moon   over a mannered sea,   presided at the family reunion,   the twelve grandchildren   you used to wear on your wrist,   a three-months-old baby,   a fat check you never wrote,   the red-haired toddler who danced the twist,   your aging daughters, each one a wife,   each one talking to the family cook,   each one avoiding your portrait,   each one aping your life.     Later, after the party,   after the house went to bed,   I sat up drinking the Christmas brandy,   watching your picture,   letting the tree move in and out of focus.     The bulbs vibrated.     They were a halo over your forehead.     Then they were a beehive,   blue, yellow, green, red;   each with its own juice, each hot and alive   stinging your face.   But you did not move.     I continued to watch, forcing myself,   waiting, inexhaustible, thirty-five.     I wanted your eyes, like the shadows   of two small birds, to change.     But they did not age.     The smile that gathered me in, all wit,   all charm, was invincible.     Hour after hour I looked at your face   but I could not pull the roots out of it.     Then I watched how the sun hit your red sweater, your withered neck,   your badly painted flesh-pink skin.     You who led me by the nose, I saw you as you were.     Then I thought of your body   as one thinks of murder--     Then I said Mary--   Mary, Mary, forgive me   and then I touched a present for the child,   the last I bred before your death;   and then I touched my breast   and then I touched the floor   and then my breast again as if,   somehow, it were one of yours."
"Perhaps I was born kneeling,  born coughing on the long winter,  born expecting the kiss of mercy,  born with a passion for quickness  and yet, as things progressed,  I learned early about the stockade  or taken out, the fume of the enema.    By two or three I learned not to kneel,  not to expect, to plant my fires underground  where none but the dolls, perfect and awful,  could be whispered to or laid down to die.      Now that I have written many words,  and let out so many loves, for so many,  and been altogether what I always was -   a woman of excess, of zeal and greed,  I find the effort useless.    Do I not look in the mirror,  these days,  and see a drunken rat avert her eyes?  Do I not feel the hunger so acutely  that I would rather die than look  into its face?  I kneel once more,  in case mercy should come  in the nick of time."
"You always read about it:  the plumber with the twelve children  who wins the Irish Sweepstakes.    From toilets to riches.    That story.      Or the nursemaid,  some luscious sweet from Denmark  who captures the oldest son's heart.    from diapers to Dior.    That story.      Or a milkman who serves the wealthy,  eggs, cream, butter, yogurt, milk,  the white truck like an ambulance  who goes into real estate  and makes a pile.    From homogenized to martinis at lunch.      Or the charwoman  who is on the bus when it cracks up  and collects enough from the insurance.    From mops to Bonwit Teller.    That story.      Once  the wife of a rich man was on her deathbed  and she said to her daughter Cinderella:  Be devout.   Be good.   Then I will smile  down from heaven in the seam of a cloud.    The man took another wife who had  two daughters, pretty enough  but with hearts like blackjacks.    Cinderella was their maid.    She slept on the sooty hearth each night  and walked around looking like Al Jolson.    Her father brought presents home from town,  jewels and gowns for the other women  but the twig of a tree for Cinderella.    She planted that twig on her mother's grave  and it grew to a tree where a white dove sat.    Whenever she wished for anything the dove  would drop it like an egg upon the ground.    The bird is important, my dears, so heed him.      Next came the ball, as you all know.    It was a marriage market.    The prince was looking for a wife.    All but Cinderella were preparing  and gussying up for the event.    Cinderella begged to go too.    Her stepmother threw a dish of lentils  into the cinders and said: Pick them  up in an hour and you shall go.    The white dove brought all his friends;  all the warm wings of the fatherland came,  and picked up the lentils in a jiffy.    No, Cinderella, said the stepmother,  you have no clothes and cannot dance.    That's the way with stepmothers.      Cinderella went to the tree at the grave  and cried forth like a gospel singer:  Mama! Mama! My turtledove,  send me to the prince's ball!  The bird dropped down a golden dress  and delicate little slippers.    Rather a large package for a simple bird.    So she went.   Which is no surprise.    Her stepmother and sisters didn't  recognize her without her cinder face  and the prince took her hand on the spot  and danced with no other the whole day.      As nightfall came she thought she'd better  get home.   The prince walked her home  and she disappeared into the pigeon house  and although the prince took an axe and broke  it open she was gone.   Back to her cinders.    These events repeated themselves for three days.    However on the third day the prince  covered the palace steps with cobbler's wax  and Cinderella's gold shoe stuck upon it.    Now he would find whom the shoe fit  and find his strange dancing girl for keeps.    He went to their house and the two sisters  were delighted because they had lovely feet.    The eldest went into a room to try the slipper on  but her big toe got in the way so she simply  sliced it off and put on the slipper.    The prince rode away with her until the white dove  told him to look at the blood pouring forth.    That is the way with amputations.    They just don't heal up like a wish.    The other sister cut off her heel  but the blood told as blood will.    The prince was getting tired.    He began to feel like a shoe salesman.    But he gave it one last try.    This time Cinderella fit into the shoe  like a love letter into its envelope.      At the wedding ceremony  the two sisters came to curry favor  and the white dove pecked their eyes out.    Two hollow spots were left  like soup spoons.      Cinderella and the prince  lived, they say, happily ever after,  like two dolls in a museum case  never bothered by diapers or dust,  never arguing over the timing of an egg,  never telling the same story twice,  never getting a middle-aged spread,  their darling smiles pasted on for eternity.    Regular Bobbsey Twins.    That story."
"Put on a clean shirt  before you die, some Russian said.    Nothing with drool, please,  no egg spots, no blood,  no sweat, no sperm.    You want me clean, God,  so I'll try to comply.      The hat I was married in,  will it do?  White, broad, fake flowers in a tiny array.    It's old-fashioned, as stylish as a bedbug,  but is suits to die in something nostalgic.      And I'll take  my painting shirt  washed over and over of course  spotted with every yellow kitchen I've painted.    God, you don't mind if I bring all my kitchens?  They hold the family laughter and the soup.      For a bra  (need we mention it?),  the padded black one that my lover demeaned  when I took it off.    He said, ""Where'd it all go?""    And I'll take  the maternity skirt of my ninth month,  a window for the love-belly  that let each baby pop out like and apple,  the water breaking in the restaurant,  making a noisy house I'd like to die in.      For underpants I'll pick white cotton,  the briefs of my childhood,  for it was my mother's dictum  that nice girls wore only white cotton.    If my mother had lived to see it  she would have put a WANTED sign up in the post office  for the black, the red, the blue I've worn.    Still, it would be perfectly fine with me  to die like a nice girl  smelling of Clorox and Duz.    Being sixteen-in-the-pants  I would die full of questions."
"Roach, foulest of creatures,  who attacks with yellow teeth  and an army of cousins big as shoes,  you are lumps of coal that are mechanized  and when I turn on the light you scuttle  into the corners and there is this hiss upon the land.    Yet I know you are only the common angel  turned into, by way of enchantment, the ugliest.    Your uncle was made into an apple.    Your aunt was made into a Siamese cat,  all the rest were made into butterflies  but because you lied to God outrightly--  told him that all things on earth were in order--  He turned his wrath upon you and said,  I will make you the most loathsome,  I will make you into God's lie,  and never will a little girl fondle you  or hold your dark wings cupped in her palm.      But that was not true.   Once in New Orleans  with a group of students a roach fled across  the floor and I shrieked and she picked it up  in her hands and held it from my fear for one hour.    And held it like a diamond ring that should not escape.    These days even the devil is getting overturned  and held up to the light like a glass of water."
"I was tired of being a woman,  tired of the spoons and the post,  tired of my mouth and my breasts,  tired of the cosmetics and the silks.    There were still men who sat at my table,  circled around the bowl I offered up.    The bowl was filled with purple grapes  and the flies hovered in for the scent  and even my father came with his white bone.    But I was tired of the gender things.      Last night I had a dream  and I said to it...    ""You are the answer.    You will outlive my husband and my father.  ""  In that dream there was a city made of chains  where Joan was put to death in man's clothes  and the nature of the angels went unexplained,  no two made in the same species,  one with a nose, one with an ear in its hand,  one chewing a star and recording its orbit,  each one like a poem obeying itself,  performing God's functions,  a people apart.      ""You are the answer,""  I said, and entered,  lying down on the gates of the city.    Then the chains were fastened around me  and I lost my common gender and my final aspect.    Adam was on the left of me  and Eve was on the right of me,  both thoroughly inconsistent with the world of reason.    We wove our arms together  and rode under the sun.    I was not a woman anymore,  not one thing or the other.      O daughters of Jerusalem,  the king has brought me into his chamber.    I am black and I am beautiful.    I've been opened and undressed.    I have no arms or legs.    I'm all one skin like a fish.    I'm no more a woman  than Christ was a man."
"It is in the small things we see it.    The child's first step,  as awesome as an earthquake.    The first time you rode a bike,  wallowing up the sidewalk.    The first spanking when your heart  went on a journey all alone.    When they called you crybaby  or poor or fatty or crazy  and made you into an alien,  you drank their acid  and concealed it.      Later,  if you faced the death of bombs and bullets  you did not do it with a banner,  you did it with only a hat to  comver your heart.    You did not fondle the weakness inside you  though it was there.    Your courage was a small coal  that you kept swallowing.    If your buddy saved you  and died himself in so doing,  then his courage was not courage,  it was love; love as simple as shaving soap.      Later,  if you have endured a great despair,  then you did it alone,  getting a transfusion from the fire,  picking the scabs off your heart,  then wringing it out like a sock.    Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow,  you gave it a back rub  and then you covered it with a blanket  and after it had slept a while  it woke to the wings of the roses  and was transformed.      Later,  when you face old age and its natural conclusion  your courage will still be shown in the little ways,  each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen,  those you love will live in a fever of love,  and you'll bargain with the calendar  and at the last moment  when death opens the back door  you'll put on your carpet slippers  and stride out."
" My doctor, the comedian  I called you every time  and made you laugh yourself  when I wrote this silly rhyme.  .  .         Each time I give lectures   or gather in the grants   you send me off to boarding school   in training pants.      God damn it, father-doctor,  I'm really thirty-six.    I see dead rats in the toilet.    I'm one of the lunatics.      Disgusted, mother put me  on the potty.   She was good at this.    My father was fat on scotch.    It leaked from every orifice.      Oh the enemas of childhood,  reeking of outhouses and shame!  Yet you rock me in your arms  and whisper my nickname.      Or else you hold my hand  and teach me love too late.    And that's the hand of the arm  they tried to amputate.      Though I was almost seven  I was an awful brat.    I put it in the Easy Wringer.    It came out nice and flat.      I was an instant cripple  from my finger to my shoulder.    The laundress wept and swooned.    My mother had to hold her.      I know I was a cripple.    Of course, I'd known it from the start.    My father took the crowbar  and broke the wringer's heart.      The surgeons shook their heads.    They really didn't know--  Would the cripple inside of me  be a cripple that would show?    My father was a perfect man,  clean and rich and fat.    My mother was a brilliant thing.    She was good at that.      You hold me in your arms.    How strange that you're so tender!  Child-woman that I am,  you think that you can mend her.      As for the arm,  unfortunately it grew.    Though mother said a withered arm  would put me in Who's Who.      For years she has described it.    She sang it like a hymn.    By then she loved the shrunken thing,  my little withered limb.      My father's cells clicked each night,  intent on making money.    And as for my cells, they brooded,  little queens, on honey.      Oh boys too, as a matter of fact,  and cigarettes and cars.    Mother frowned at my wasted life.    My father smoked cigars.      My cheeks blossomed with maggots.    I picked at them like pearls.    I covered them with pancake.    I wound my hair in curls.      My father didn't know me  but you kiss me in my fever.    My mother knew me twice  and then I had to leave her.      But those are just two stories  and I have more to tell  from the outhouse, the greenhouse  where you draw me out of hell.      Father, I am thirty-six,  yet I lie here in your crib.    I'm getting born again, Adam,  as you prod me with your rib."
" We sail out of season into on oyster-gray wind,  over a terrible hardness.    Where Dickens crossed with mal de mer  in twenty weeks or twenty days  I cross toward him in five.    Wraped in robes--  not like Caesar but like liver with bacon--  I rest on the stern  burning my mouth with a wind-hot ash,  watching my ship  bypass the swells  as easily as an old woman reads a palm.    I think; as I look North, that a field of mules  lay down to die.      The ship is 27 hours out.    I have entered her.    She might be a whale,  sleeping 2000 and ship's company,  the last 40Â¢ martini  and steel staterooms where night goes on forever.    Being inside them is, I think,  the way one would dig into a planet  and forget the word light.    I have walked cities,  miles of mole alleys with carpets.    Inside I have been ten girls who speak French.    They languish everywhere like bedsheets.      Oh my Atlantic of the cracked shores,  those blemished gates of Rockport and Boothbay,  those harbor smells like the innards of animals!  Old childish Queen, where did you go,  you bayer at wharfs and Victorian houses?    I have read each page of my mother's voyage.    I have read each page of her mother's voyage.    I have learned their words as they learned Dickens'.    I have swallowed these words like bullets.    But I have forgotten the last guest--terror.    Unlike them, I cannot toss in the cabin  as in childbirth.    Now always leaving me in the West  is the wake,  a ragged bridal veil, unexplained,  seductive, always rushing down the stairs,  never detained, never enough.      The ship goes on  as though nothing else were happening.    Generation after generation,  I go her way.    She will run East, knot by knot, over an old bloodstream,  stripping it clear,  each hour ripping it, pounding, pounding,  forcing through as through a virgin.    Oh she is so quick!  This dead street never stops!"
" In Memoriam    What's missing is the eyeballs  in each of us, but it doesn't matter  because you've got the bucks, the bucks, the bucks.    You let me touch them, fondle the green faces  lick at their numbers and it lets you be  my ""Daddy!"" ""Daddy!"" and though I fought all alone  with molesters and crooks, I knew your money  would save me, your courage, your ""I've had  considerable experience as a soldier.  .  .    fighting to win millions for myself, it's true.    But I did win,"" and me praying for ""our men out there""  just made it okay to be an orphan whose blood was no one's,  whose curls were hung up on a wire machine and electrified,  while you built and unbuilt intrigues called nations,  and did in the bad ones, always, always,  and always came at my perils, the black Christs of childhood,  always came when my heart stood naked in the street  and they threw apples at it or twelve-day-old-dead-fish.      ""Daddy!"" ""Daddy,"" we all won that war,  when you sang me the money songs  Annie, Annie you sang  and I knew you drove a pure gold car  and put diamonds in you coke  for the crunchy sound, the adorable sound  and the moon too was in your portfolio,  as well as the ocean with its sleepy dead.    And I was always brave, wasn't I?  I never bled?  I never saw a man expose himself.    No.   No.    I never saw a drunkard in his blubber.    I never let lightning go in one car and out the other.    And all the men out there were never to come.    Never, like a deluge, to swim over my breasts  and lay their lamps in my insides.    No.   No.    Just me and my ""Daddy""  and his tempestuous bucks  rolling in them like corn flakes  and only the bad ones died.      But I died yesterday,  ""Daddy,"" I died,  swallowing the Nazi-Jap animal  and it won't get out  it keeps knocking at my eyes,  my big orphan eyes,  kicking! Until eyeballs pop out  and even my dog puts up his four feet  and lets go  of his military secret  with his big red tongue  flying up and down  like yours should have    as we board our velvet train."
" They work with herbs  and penicillin  They work with gentleness  and the scalpel.    They dig out the cancer,  close an incision  and say a prayer  to the poverty of the skin.    They are not Gods  though they would like to be;  they are only a human  trying to fix up a human.    Many humans die.    They die like the tender,  palpitating berries  in November.    But all along the doctors remember:  First do no harm.    They would kiss if it would heal.    It would not heal.      If the doctors cure  then the sun sees it.    If the doctors kill  then the earth hides it.    The doctors should fear arrogance  more than cardiac arrest.    If they are too proud,  and some are,  then they leave home on horseback  but God returns them on foot."
" Old Man    Old man, it's four flights up and for what?  Your room is hardly bigger than your bed.    Puffing as you climb, you are a brown woodcut  stooped over the thin tail and the wornout tread.      The room will do.   All that's left of the old life  is jampacked on shelves from floor to ceiling  like a supermarket: your books, your dead wife  generously fat in her polished frame, the congealing    bowl of cornflakes sagging in their instant milk,  your hot plate and your one luxury, a telephone.    You leave your door open, lounging in maroon silk  and smiling at the other roomers who live alone.    Well, almost alone.   Through the old-fashioned wall  the fellow next door has a girl who comes to call.      Twice a week at noon during their lunch hour  they puase by your door to peer into your world.    They speak sadly as if the wine they carry would sour  or as if the mattress would not keep them curled    together, extravagantly young in their tight lock.    Old man, you are their father holding court  in the dingy hall until their alarm clock  rings and unwinds them.   You unstopper the quart    of brandy you've saved, examining the small print  in the telephone book.   The phone in your lap is all  that's left of your family name.   Like a Romanoff prince  you stay the same in your small alcove off the hall.    Castaway, your time is a flat sea that doesn't stop,  with no new land to make for and no new stories to swap.         Seamstress    I'm at pains to know what else I could have done  but move him out of his parish, him being my son;    him being the only one at home since his Pa  left us to beat the Japs at Okinawa.      I put the gold star up in the front window  beside the flag.   Alterations is what I know    and what I did: hems, gussets and seams.    When my boy had the fever and the bad dreams    I paid for the clinic exam and a pack of lies.    As a youngster his private parts were undersize.      I thought of his Pa, that muscly old laugh he had  and the boy was thin as a moth, but never once bad,    as smart as a rooster! To hear some neighbors tell,  Your kid! He'll go far.   He'll marry well.      So when he talked of taking the cloth, I thought  I'd talk him out of it.   You're all I got,    I told him.   For six years he studied up.   I prayed  against God Himself for my boy.   But he stayed.      Christ was a hornet inside his head.   I guess  I'd better stitch the zipper in this dress.      I guess I'll get along.   I always did.    Across the hall from me's an old invalid,    aside of him, a young one -- he carries on  with a girl who pretends she comes to use the john.      The old one with the bad breath and his bed all mussed,  he smiles and talks to them.   He's got some crust.      Sure as hell, what else could I have done  but pack up and move in here, him being my son?       Young Girl    Dear love, as simple as some distant evil  we walk a little drunk up these three flughts  where you tacked a Dufy print above your army cot.      The thin apartment doors on the way up will  not tell us.   We are saying, we have our rights  and let them see the sandwiches and wine we bought    for we do not explain my husband's insane abuse  and we do not say why your wild-haired wife has fled  or that my father opened like a walnut and then was dead.    Your palms fold over me like knees.   Love is the only use.      Both a little drunk in the afternoon  with the forgotten smart of August on our skin  we hold hands as if we were still children who trudge    up the wooden tower, on up past that close platoon  of doors, past the dear old man who always asks us in  and the one who sews like a wasp and will not budge.      Climbing the dark halls, I ignore their papers and pails,  the twelve coats of rubbish of someone else's dim life.    Tell them need is an excuse for love.   Tell them need prevails.    Tell them I remake and smooth your bed and am your wife."
"Teeth of flowers, hairnet of dew,  hands of herbs, you, perfect wet nurse,  prepare the earthly sheets for me  and the down quilt of weeded moss.      I am going to sleep, my nurse, put me to bed.    Set a lamp at my headboard;  a constellation; whatever you like;  all are good: lower it a bit.      Leave me alone: you hear the buds breaking through...    a celestial foot rocks you from above  and a bird traces a pattern for you    so you'll forget...   Thank you.   Oh, one request:  if he telephones again  tell him not to keep trying for I have left...  "
"The sky a black sphere,  the sea a black disk.      The lighthouse opens  its solar fan on the coast.      Spinning endlessly at night,  whom is it searching for    when the mortal heart  looks for me in the chest?    Look at the black rock  where it is nailed down.      A crow digs endlessly  but no longer bleeds."
" Little little man, little little man,  set free your canary that wants to fly.    I am that canary, little little man,  leave me to fly.      I was in your cage, little little man,  little little man who gave me my cage.    I say ""little little"" because you don't understand me  Nor will you understand.      Nor do I understand you, but meanwhile,  open for me the cage from which I want to escape.    Little little man, I loved you half an hour,  Don't ask me again."
" You said the word that enamors  My hearing.   You already forgot.   Good.    Sleep peacefully.   Your face should  Be serene and beautiful at all hours.      When the seductive mouth enchants  It should be fresh, your speech pleasant;  For your office as lover it's not good  That many tears come from your face.      More glorious destinies reclaim you  That were brought, between the black wells  Of the dark circles beneath your eyes,  the seer in pain.      The bottom, summit of the beautiful victims!  The foolish spade of some barbarous king  Did more harm to the world and your statue."
" My melancholy was gold dust in your hands;  On your long hands I scattered my life;  My sweetnesses remained clutched in your hands;  Now I am a vial of perfume, emptied    How much sweet torture quietly suffered,  When, my soul wrested with shadowy sadness,  She who knows the tricks, I passed the days  kissing the two hands that stifled my life."
"Today my mother and sisters  came to see me.    I had been alone a long time  with my poems, my pride ...   almost nothing.    My sister---the oldest---is grown up,  is blondish.   An elemental dream  goes through her eyes: I told the youngest  ""Life is sweet.   Everything bad comes to an end.""    My mother smiled as those who understand souls  tend to do;  She placed two hands on my shoulders.    She's staring at me ."
"Oh, there are eyes that he can see,   And hands to make his hands rejoice,  But to my lover I must be   Only a voice.      Oh, there are breasts to bear his head,   And lips whereon his lips can lie,  But I must be till I am dead   Only a cry."
" There! See the line of lights,  A chain of stars down either side the street --  Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,  A necklace for my throat? I'd twist it round  And you could play with it.   You smile at me  As though I were a little dreamy child  Behind whose eyes the fairies live.   .   .   .   And see,  The people on the street look up at us  All envious.   We are a king and queen,  Our royal carriage is a motor bus,  We watch our subjects with a haughty joy.   .   .   .    How still you are! Have you been hard at work  And are you tired to-night? It is so long  Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.    My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts  Like early flowers in an April meadow,  And I must give them to you, all of them,  Before they fade.   The people I have met,  The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things  That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows  That hurry, gesturing along a wall,  Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real  And take their proper size here in my heart  When you have seen them.   .   .   .   There's the Plaza now,  A lake of light! To-night it almost seems  That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,  Drawn somehow toward you.   See the open park  Lying below us with a million lamps  Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.    We look down on them as God must look down  On constellations floating under Him  Tangled in clouds.   .   .   .   Come, then, and let us walk  Since we have reached the park.   It is our garden,  All black and blossomless this winter night,  But we bring April with us, you and I;  We set the whole world on the trail of spring.    I think that every path we ever took  Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,  Delicate gold that only fairies see.    When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks  And come out on the drowsy park, they look  Along the empty paths and say, ""Oh, here  They went, and here, and here, and here! Come, see,  Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance  About it in a windy ring and make  A circle round it only they can cross  When they come back again!"" .   .   .   Look at the lake --  Do you remember how we watched the swans  That night in late October while they slept?  Swans must have stately dreams, I think.   But now  The lake bears only thin reflected lights  That shake a little.   How I long to take  One from the cold black water -- new-made gold  To give you in your hand! And see, and see,  There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!  Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down  Your hand could almost reach it up to me.   .   .   .      There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --  I wish you could have had it for a cup  With stars like dew to fill it to the brim.   .   .   .      How cold it is! Even the lights are cold;  They have put shawls of fog around them, see!  What if the air should grow so dimly white  That we would lose our way along the paths  Made new by walls of moving mist receding  The more we follow.   .   .   .   What a silver night!  That was our bench the time you said to me  The long new poem -- but how different now,  How eerie with the curtain of the fog  Making it strange to all the friendly trees!  There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls  Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.    Walk on a little, let me stand here watching  To see you, too, grown strange to me and far.   .   .   .    I used to wonder how the park would be  If one night we could have it all alone --  No lovers with close arm-encircled waists  To whisper and break in upon our dreams.    And now we have it! Every wish comes true!  We are alone now in a fleecy world;  Even the stars have gone.   We two alone!"
" There is no magic any more,   We meet as other people do,  You work no miracle for me   Nor I for you.      You were the wind and I the sea --   There is no splendor any more,  I have grown listless as the pool   Beside the shore.      But though the pool is safe from storm   And from the tide has found surcease,  It grows more bitter than the sea,   For all its peace."
"Oh, I have sown my love so wide   That he will find it everywhere;  It will awake him in the night,   It will enfold him in the air.      I set my shadow in his sight   And I have winged it with desire,  That it may be a cloud by day,   And in the night a shaft of fire."
" I am alone, in spite of love,  In spite of all I take and give -   In spite of all your tenderness,  Sometimes I am not glad to live.      I am alone, as though I stood  On the highest peak of the tired gray world,  About me only swirling snow,  Above me, endless space unfurled;    With earth hidden and heaven hidden,  And only my own spirit's pride  To keep me from the peace of those  Who are not lonely, having died."
"Now at last I have come to see what life is,  Nothing is ever ended, everything only begun,  And the brave victories that seem so splendid  Are never really won.      Even love that I built my spirit's house for,  Comes like a brooding and a baffled guest,  And music and men's praise and even laughter  Are not so good as rest."
"Oh, because you never tried  To bow my will or break my pride,  And nothing of the cave-man made  You want to keep me half afraid,  Nor ever with a conquering air  You thought to draw me unaware --  Take me, for I love you more  Than I ever loved before.      And since the body's maidenhood  Alone were neither rare nor good  Unless with it I gave to you  A spirit still untrammeled, too,  Take my dreams and take my mind  That were masterless as wind;  And ""Master!"" I shall say to you  Since you never asked me to."
"How many million Aprils came   Before I ever knew  How white a cherry bough could be,   A bed of squills, how blue!    And many a dancing April   When life is done with me,  Will lift the blue flame of the flower   And the white flame of the tree.      Oh burn me with your beauty, then,   Oh hurt me, tree and flower,  Lest in the end death try to take   Even this glistening hour.      O shaken flowers, O shimmering trees,   O sunlit white and blue,  Wound me, that I, through endless sleep,   May bear the scar of you."
"I have come to bury Love   Beneath a tree,  In the forest tall and black   Where none can see.      I shall put no flowers at his head,   Nor stone at his feet,  For the mouth I loved so much   Was bittersweet.      I shall go no more to his grave,   For the woods are cold.    I shall gather as much of joy   As my hands can hold.      I shall stay all day in the sun   Where the wide winds blow, --  But oh, I shall cry at night   When none will know."
"The April night is still and sweet   With flowers on every tree;  Peace comes to them on quiet feet,   But not to me.      My peace is hidden in his breast   Where I shall never be;  Love comes to-night to all the rest,   But not to me."
"Come, when the pale moon like a petal   Floats in the pearly dusk of spring,  Come with arms outstretched to take me,   Come with lips pursed up to cling.      Come, for life is a frail moth flying,   Caught in the web of the years that pass,  And soon we two, so warm and eager,   Will be as the gray stones in the grass."
" Did you never know, long ago, how much you loved me -   That your love would never lessen and never go?  You were young then, proud and fresh-hearted,  You were too young to know.      Fate is a wind, and red leaves fly before it  Far apart, far away in the gusty time of year -   Seldom we meet now, but when I hear you speaking,  I know your secret, my dear, my dear."
"My soul lives in my body's house,   And you have both the house and her -   But sometimes she is less your own   Than a wild, gay adventurer;  A restless and an eager wraith,   How can I tell what she will do -   Oh, I am sure of my body's faith,   But what if my soul broke faith with you?"
"I am not yours, not lost in you,   Not lost, although I long to be   Lost as a candle lit at noon,   Lost as a snowflake in the sea.       You love me, and I find you still   A spirit beautiful and bright,   Yet I am I, who long to be   Lost as a light is lost in light.       Oh plunge me deep in love - put out   My senses, leave me deaf and blind,   Swept by the tempest of your love,   A taper in a rushing wind."
