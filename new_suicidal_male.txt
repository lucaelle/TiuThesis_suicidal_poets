Poem
   I left here at eight      And returned at 75.      In between             I largely wasted America.      I married, had children,      Distinguished myself in a profession             Full of fools, becoming one myself,      As is the way      Of this (or, I suppose, of any other) world.             I missed      The Nobel but I did bring down      The Pulitzer. The weather,             The politics, the stars,      And my own small contribution      All lined up, and I got one.             So “Pulitzer” became my middle name      Before I came here, where no one cares      A whit about such things.             I failed at love.      That’s where I truly fucked up.      I couldn’t.             The women in this town      Are mostly severe, resentful      —The men bitter, disappointed:             A perfect place for my purposes.      I stay in a room      In the house of an old woman             Who doesn’t want to have sex any more      And neither do I      So we do not             Trouble each other on that front,      Which is good.      I do like to drink.             I used to love to eat      But then I don’t much      Give a shit             About any of that now.      The old woman sometimes says wistfully      God will soon be calling both of us             Back home, but as an agnostic      I don’t believe that.      As an American,             I don’t buy that.      I came here to retire from love,      To face my failure to love             As I attempted to face everything      Else before, and that      Is exactly what I am doing and doing             With the exactness I used to put into      My work, for which I received the Pulitzer.      I hate a coward.             My son      Came here the other day and asked      Exactly when I might             Be coming back      And I sent him off without an answer.      The answer             Seems to be staying here,      Staying honestly here and coming to terms      With my greatest single failure.             My wife is dead. To me,      It seems I am left over      To eat a shit sandwich.             “Eat me,” the world says,      Now that I have lost my appetite.      We used to say, “Eat me”      To each other in high school,      Another thing from which no one      Ever recovers. America likes to think             Every one can recover from every thing,      But about this,      Especially, America is wrong.   
   Home from school at six years old, first grade,      And uncle there to tell me Mommy      Gone, Mommy not be coming back any             Time soon, Liam, Mommy had to go to      Mental hospital. Nervous breakdown.      Years later Mommy, when she gets out             Of mental, often says, “If you’re      A bad boy for me Liam you’re      Going to send me back, back             Into mental hospital, like you did      First time.” At 13      I find out Mom had been doing years             In a federal prison all that time,      For stealing, so no mental hospital for      Mommy. Breakdown ours alone.             I was on my own.   
   Soon the summer      Now the pleasant purgatory      Of spring is over,             Soon the choking      Humidity      In the city             On the fire escapes      In a sleeveless T-shirt      Smoking a cigar             In tune with the tremor      Of the mindless yellow      Commercial traffic             Moving in the city,      Where no one really      Buys a car,             American      Or otherwise,      Where we will,             As Rilke said we would      Where we will      Wake, read, write             Long letters      And in the avenues      Wander restlessly             To and fro      On foot in      The humidity,             Where soon I’ll shower, dress,      Take the dog out for a piss,      And mail this.   
   the Venetian blinds I dusted offfor my mother on Saturday mornings,closing, opening them with the pull cord a fewtimes just to watch the outside universe keep blinking,as the flock suddenly rises from November stubble,hovers a few seconds, closing, opening,blinking, before it tilts, then vanishes over a hill.   
   No one kneads us again out of earth and clay,   no one incants our dust.   No one.   Blessèd art thou, No One.   In thy sight would   we bloom.   In thy   spite.   A Nothing   we were, are now, and ever   shall be, blooming:   the Nothing-, the   No-One's-Rose.   With   our pistil soul-bright,   our stamen heaven-waste,   our corona red   from the purpleword we sang   over, O over   the thorn.   
   They live alone together,     she with her wide hind and bird face, he with his hung belly and crewcut.     They never talk but keep busy.     Today they are washing windows (each window together) she on the inside, he on the outside. He squirts Windex at her face, she squirts Windex at his face.     Now they are waving to each other with rags,     not smiling.   
   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not             want him for long.   
   A porcupine skin, Stiff with bad tanning, It must have ended somewhere. Stuffed horned owl Pompous Yellow eyed; Chuck-wills-widow on a biassed twig Sooted with dust. Piles of old magazines, Drawers of boy’s letters And the line of love They must have ended somewhere. Yesterday’s Tribune is gone Along with youth And the canoe that went to pieces on the beach The year of the big storm When the hotel burned down At Seney, Michigan.   
   Soldiers never do die well;          Crosses mark the places— Wooden crosses where they fell,          Stuck above their faces. Soldiers pitch and cough and twitch—          All the world roars red and black; Soldiers smother in a ditch,          Choking through the whole attack.   
   For we have thought the longer thoughts     And gone the shorter way. And we have danced to devils’ tunes,     Shivering home to pray; To serve one master in the night,     Another in the day.   
   There are never any suicides in the quarter among people one knows No successful suicides. A Chinese boy kills himself and is dead. (they continue to place his mail in the letter rack at the Dome) A Norwegian boy kills himself and is dead. (no one knows where the other Norwegian boy has gone) They find a model dead alone in bed and very dead. (it made almost unbearable trouble for the concierge) Sweet oil, the white of eggs, mustard and water, soap suds and stomach pumps rescue the people one knows. Every afternoon the people one knows can be found at the café.   
   In the rain in the rain in the rain in the rain in Spain. Does it rain in Spain? Oh yes my dear on the contrary and there are no bull fights. The dancers dance in long white pants It isn’t right to yence your aunts Come Uncle, let’s go home. Home is where the heart is, home is where the fart is. Come let us fart in the home. There is no art in a fart. Still a fart may not be artless. Let us fart an artless fart in the home. Democracy. Democracy. Bill says democracy must go. Go democracy. Go Go Go Bill’s father would never knowingly sit down at table with a Democrat. Now Bill says democracy must go. Go on democracy. Democracy is the shit. Relativity is the shit. Dictators are the shit. Menken is the shit. Waldo Frank is the shit. The Broom is the shit. Dada is the shit. Dempsey is the shit. This is not a complete list. They say Ezra is the shit. But Ezra is nice. Come let us build a monument to Ezra. Good a very nice monument. You did that nicely Can you do another? Let me try and do one. Let us all try and do one. Let the little girl over there on the corner try and do one. Come on little girl. Do one for Ezra. Good. You have all been successful children. Now let us clean the mess up. The Dial does a monument to Proust. We have done a monument to Ezra. A monument is a monument. After all it is the spirit of the thing that counts.   
   I   Or Your Woman   The night was a bad one.   I only saw one other person out:   A big black man on muleback   Riding along the levee, marking the water.   There was a lantern in his hand   And what you could call a grim smile on the lips.   I shifted down gears,   Rolled down the window, turned the radio low.   And said, “Say there, man, how goes it?”   But he couldn’t hear me for the rain   And the song on his transistor radio.   “I don’t know,” he said, “but it’s raining,   Raining to beat hell.”   Said I, “Do you think it’s going to quit?”   “Friend, I couldn’t tell you.”   When big water will, you call everyman friend . . .   We said our goodnights,   Went on, by mule and flatbed truck, wearing black   Rubber, cold to the bone,   Like divers from different ships meeting below.   All you can do is nod, some of the times.   At least, we spoke, knowing that living   Anywhere near the river   You speak when you can; the only thing you try   To hold is your liquor,   And we had none, that bad night on the levee.   Always down the road, I looked up   In the mirror.  And I’m sure he’d a done the same.   II   Midnight   I almost slid off, once   Imagining this cloud was a pall   And the moon was a body.   I don’t know who put coins over her eyes.   When I got to Rampion’s Ferry,   I thought I was the only one there.   I mean it was quiet,   Except for the current, the cables, and the rain.   I got a piece of rope   Out of the back of my truck, and wound it   Around the generator   Engine; it kicked right off the first pull.   The yellow bug lights came on,   And I saw a body move under a purple blanket.   He cussed me out   For waking him up, pulling his old self up.   There was some kind of fish   In the weave of his poncho; other figures   Of snakes and birds, too.   I didn’t mean to wake the awnry fellow up,   I wonder if I did.   A strange odor came from underneath him   When he dragged out his towsack.   It didn’t smell of something burning, but of   Something that was singed.   Like the rain, it didn’t let up.   “Are we going crosst it, or not,”   He told me in a voice, half-blooded song.   III   Some Past Twelve   Someone with a light   Rode up before I could see what all   He was pulling from the burlap:      Blue calling chalk you find in pool halls, ivory   Tusks, a stringer with rotten heads   The good book and another I couldn’t pronounce—   Just as worn,   And one of those paperweight crystals that snows.   He had strummed the mandolin twice,   A couple of sounds blue as a fox in trouble   In a snowdrift on a ridge, like weeds   Burning underwater, a few licks of silent fire.   When I recognized the lookout   The ferry wasn’t more than a few feet off the bank,   So the mule made it aboard, easy;   Its hooves on the planks like a mad, rough carpenter   Nailing driftwood together.   Oh, we made it across.  We didn’t exactly   Hit the dock on the head,   But we floated on down to Vahalia’s Landing.   We had a good time.   The foreigner played the mandolin, the river   Reached its crest,   And the man on the mule and I drank way into the morning.   They heard us, the ones on land.   “We’re a floating whorehouse, without noun women.”   And in the dead of night,   Rain and all, we motioned them on.   
   The white clothes on the line put the man to sleep.   He was sitting on a soda case   Leaning back on the porch.   He rolled down his sleeves with his eyes shut.   He could feel the sun going into the trees.   He wanted to catch the evening ferry   And meet someone across the river.   He dreamed about her   Putting polish on her nails.   He was in the woods and many women   Were walking around him in a circle.   He thought about crosses in their blood.   As it got to be night he could feel the heat in his face.   He was going to open his eyes.   And look up at the moon.   It was like the light blue handkerchief   She gave him to go with his dark suit.   That’s when he felt the hot salt all over him   Like broken glass.   He was afraid to open his eyes.   He wondered if he could use any words on it.   But the big woman in the black dress   Was already in the backseat of the car   Rolling the window up with one hand   And making a sign on him with the other.   She was in the car, too.   He saw her biting her nails when they pulled away.   There was a dead snake on his shoes.   He knew there would be a circle   Of little beating hearts in his bed,   And before he could get home   They would be dry and still.

   We go on and we tremble.   God says we can screw now.   God says to give up all your lovers,   Time to die.   When I was younger I drove a Lincoln.   God said to trade it in.   A tad lovely, then, and terrible,   And sick of my own kind,   I wanted to become a woman.   I wanted to wash the feet of other women   In public, I wanted his eyes   On me, olives on the ground.   I gave you my hand,   Now I go around with my sleeve   Tucked in my coat.   I climb no trees, touch   One breast at a time,   Hold no hands myself.   I go on and I tremble   With your back in my blood,   The clap my mother left me.   With me no more, and now,   And forever, and even always   The dust of my feet   In the desert   I give you stranger my sign,   My peace,   But God you remember   You fucked me out of my hand.   
   The yolk went down my leg   Like a beautiful snail without a shell,   Went down the hill   To the skillet of water, to the nymphflies,   Into the lips of pond minnows,   Down the long belly of the gar – the hellbenders   Having dived and lost, then into   The paw of the lame panther   Who loped back to her lair with it.   As for the white, it stayed with me,   Mark of the beast, birth, and trade.   
   Is like a lyric poem   with seven basic themes   first the cottonpicker   dragging behind it a wagon of testicles   a pair of pliers which can fill in   for a cross in a pinch   then there is the warm pond   between the maiden’s thighs   next we have some friends   of yours and mine   who shall be with us always   Pablo the artist   the pubis of the moon   Pablo the cellist   panther of silence   Pablo the poet   the point of no return   and in case of emergency   the seventh and final theme   of this systematic poem   is the systematic way   death undresses in front of you   
   To the gentlemen from the south      to the tourists from the north   who write poems about the south      to the dumb-ass students   I’d like to ask one lousy question   have you ever seen a regatta of flies   sail around a pile of shit   and then come back and picnic on the shit   just once in your life have you heard   flies on shit   because I cut my eye teeth on flies   floating in shit   
            Nicanor Parra            I’m not going to lie   Through my teeth to you   Like the poets from Minnesota,   The South, and the West,   And New York City.   Most of all in life   I would like to fuck a thirteen-year-old again,   And I don’t have any hesitations   About saying I’d rather be Marlon Brando   Than I would T. S. Eliot, etc.   I have more respect for Muhammad Ali   Than any other living man.   Of course I’ve tried Esquire,   But my shoes aren’t platforms   And I don’t know shit about canoes.   Although I can’t prove it,   Most poets work for the highway dept.   There are more of them than there are   Flies and engineers.   And I stink like a dead mule under an overpass.   
            Raymond Radiguet            Like seven birds sleeping on the plateau   Overlooking the shipwreck of love, mystery   Of the drunken visitors wandering off   With your wife, men who talk with a bad accent,   The condemned the abandoned, one day of silence,   Two days of silence, dreams shattered and protected,   The more the blossoms the more you suffer.   
            Luis Buñuel            A white bull, a cassock, an antique mirror   The famous ones have passed hours in front of,   A midnight blue tuxedo, a fainting couch, a key   To a box of lewd photographs, a swastika,   Twelve bales of hay, three grave plots, a statue   Of Christ holding a heart pierced by a dagger,   A black patch, all kinds of utensils for the sick—   Including thirty-nine feet of catheter tubing,   A houseboat, a dog, a baby grand, an oar   Said to have been carved from a lovely river   And a woman’s hat by Alfred Jarry, a mattress,   A shotgun, a diving helmet, an essay on The Art   Of Taxidermy and a clitoris mounted on a ring   Like quartz, a crescent wrench, a bulldozer.      
            Raymond Roussel            Two girls runaway from the Home.  They have a revolver   in their possession.  The Sisters Of Our Lady have given up   looking for them, returning in the night with soft candles.   The sleek clouds have thrown their riders, and the bees   are returning to the honey, the clover at the edge of the      cliff black as eyelids, damp as blue mussels flexing at the moon.   The girls look in the stolen mirror, then throw their shoes   in the sea.  They take off one another’s dress, posing   on the rocks that jut out over the faded water of the last days.   The clover beat down from their splendid feet, the clover   quiet like a vault.  Nearby in a ship named for early death,   I drink wine like a city.  Anchored far off the continent of love.      Strange, but bees do not die in their own honey, and how the dead   are toted off, how the sweet moons are deposited in the catacombs.   The clover at the edge of the sea like a chemise, place   where animals have lain.  They help one another with their hair,   their dresses blowing back to land.  They look over the   cliff, spit on the beach.  Birds I have never seen going by.   
            Hans Richter            What if the moon was essence of quinine   And high heels were a time of day   When certain birds bled   The chauffeur is telling the cook   The antler would pry into ice floes   Swim with a lamp   And we’d be shivering in a ditch   Biting through a black wing   There would be boats   There would be a dream country   The great quiet humming of the soul at night   The only sound is a shovel   Clearing a place for a mailbox   
   I had my quiet time early in the morning   Eating Almond Joys with Mother.   We’d sit on the back porch and talk to God.   We really had a good time.   Later on,   I’d sort baseball cards   Or look for bottles.   In the afternoon I’d shoot blackbirds.   Jimmy would go by the house for ice water   And make the truck backfire.   Oh, I really liked that.   That was the reason he did it.   In the evening the cottontails ran across the groves.   I shot one and put him in the backseat.   He went to the bathroom.   Jimmy said I knocked the shit out of him.   At night we would listen to the ballgame.   Then to the Hoss Man.   Jimmy liked “Take Out Some Insurance On Me Baby”          by Jimmy Reed.   
   There was always a lizard   Or a frog around the pump,   Waiting for a little extra water   Or a butterfly to light.   Jimmy said the pump gave him the worms.   I got the worms under the slick boards.   The pump would bite you in the winter.   It got hold of Jimmy and wouldn’t let go.   The blades of Johnson grass were tall   And sharp around the pump stand.   I had to hoe them all the time   Nobody filled the prime jar, though.   One time, I cut the tongue   Out of a Buster Brown shoe   And gave it to the pump.   It made a good sucker washer.   Sometimes the pump seemed like Jesus.   I liked bathing buck naked   Under the pump,   Not in a goddamn washtub.   
   When the rain hits the snake in the head,   he closes his eyes and wishes he were   asleep in a tire on the side of the road,   so young boys could roll him over, forever.   
   Soon I will make my appearance   But first I must take off my rings   And swords and lay them out all   Along the lupine banks of the forbidden river   In reckoning the days I have   Left on this earth I will use   No fingers   
            after Jean Follain            In the evenings they listen to the same   tunes nobody could call happy   somebody turns up at the edge of town   the roses bloom   and an old dinner bell rings once more   under the thunder clouds   In front of the porch posts of the store   a man seated on a soda water case   turns around and spits and says   to everybody   in his new set of clothes   holding up his hands   as long as I live nobody   touches my dogs my friends   
            for Nicholas Fuhrmann            I   Pig   I was in the outhouse   I heard somebody at the pump   I looked out the chink hole   It was the two fishermen   They stole fish   One man gave the other one some money   He flipped a fifty-cent piece up   I lost it in the sun   I saw the snake doctors riding each other   The other man said “You lose”   He took something else out of his pocket   It shined   They had a tow sack   I thought they were cleaning fish   I looked up   I saw the snake doctors riding each other   I took my eye away   It was dark in the outhouse   I whistled   I heard the pump again   It sounded broken   I looked out the chink hole   It wasn’t the pump   It was the pig   The guitar player cut them out   The midget helped him   “Pump me some water, midget” he said   The pig ran off   The guitar player washed off his hands   The midget washed off the nuts   He got a drink   My eye hurt   He laughed   He cleaned the blood off his knife    He wiped            it on his leg   He started singing   The dog tried to get the nuts   But the midget kicked him   The guitar player picked them up   He put them in his pocket   The dog went over to the pig   He licked him   I pulled my pants up   I went outside   I got the pig   I walked over to the pump   I said “Don’t you ever lay a hand                  on this pig again”   The guitar player laughed   He asked me if I wanted the nuts back   He took them out of his pocket   He spit on them   He shook them like dice   He threw them on the ground   He said “Hah”   The midget stomped on them   I had the pig under my arm   He was bleeding on my foot    I said   “Midget, I got friends on that river”   II   The Acolyte   The men rode by   I passed them on the road   They smelled like dead fish   The one in front had a guitar on his back   The other one had a chain saw   I was riding the hog   He weighed three-hundred pounds   I called him Holy Ghost   The midget flashed a knife   He thumbed the blade   He smiled at me   He called me “Pig Rider”   I rode over to Baby Gauge’s   I was on my way to church   I had to get the red cassock   I tied the hog to the front porch   Baby Gauge was swinging in a tire   Born In The Camp With Six Toes was sleeping in the icebox   Baby Gauge said “Be at the levee at three o’clock”   I put the robe on   I said “I almost got drowned last time”   “Going to have a mighty good time” he said   “Going to be an eclipse” Born In The Camp With Six Toes said   I rode the hog to church   I took the new shoes off   I lit the candles   I changed the book   I rung the bell   I was drinking the wine   I heard Baby Gauge yell   I ran down the aisle   I saw the men at the trough   They were beating the hog over the head with sledge hammers   It was like the clock in the German pilot’s shack   One of his eyes was hanging out   And the trough was running over with blood   They held his head under the water   He was rooting in his own blood   He pumped it out in a mist   Like a buck shot in the lung   It was black   He broke loose   I ran down the road yelling   I stepped on soda bottle caps   I ran through sardine cans   I tripped on the cassock   The hog was crazy   He ran into the church   He ran into tombstones   I said “Somebody throw me something”   Chinaman threw me a knife   I ran after the hog   He was heading for the river   I jumped on his back   I rode the hog   I hugged his neck   I stabbed him seven times   I wanted the knife to go into me   He kept running   I ran the knife across his throat   And the blood came out like a bird   We ran into a sycamore tree   When the cloud passed over the moon   Like a turkey shutting its eye   I rowed out into the slew   Not allowing myself to sing gospel music   I woke up in a boat   It was full of blood   My feet were dragging through the water   A knife was sticking in the prow   And the sun was black   It was dark   But I saw the snake doctors riding each other   I saw my new shoes   I put them on   They filled up with blood   I took the surplice off   I threw it in the river   I watched it sink   There was hog blood in my hair   I knelt in the prow with the knife in my mouth   I looked at myself in the water   I heard someone singing on the levee   I was buried in a boat   I woke up   I set it afire with the taper   I watched myself burn   I reached in the ashes and found a red knife   I held my head under the water         so I wouldn’t go crazy   It was some commotion   I rowed the boat in a circle with one oar   A hundred people were in the water   They had white robes on   Some of them had umbrellas   They jumped up and down on the bank   They rowed down the levee   They were yelling and singing   One of them saw me   I saw a horse with tassels   I put my head under the water   I thought I was dead   I hit it on a cypress knee   Two Negroes came riding through the river   They rode towards me on the moon-blind horse   One of them was drinking soda water   “Where are you going, boy” Baby Gauge said   The horse swam back to the levee   I was with them   The boat drifted away   A man said “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego”   III   Hambone   They tied his hind legs together   And hung him in a tree with a log chain   I saw them   I was on Baby Gauge’s horse   I threw a knife at the midget   So they hung me up by the feet too   I saw them break his neck   I saw them pull his legs apart       like a wishbone   I wished the dead came back   The midget stood on a bucket   He reached up in the hog’s throat   And pulled the heart out   The dog was lying on the ground   With his mouth open   It took all day to butcher the hog   I got dizzy   I saw the snake doctors riding each other   They turned the bucket over   It filled up with blood   They made a fire   The guitar player beat his hand over his leg   He put some meat on the fire   They tried to make me eat it   The midget spit a bone on the ground   The other one picked it up   He put it on his finger   He went over and got his guitar   He tried to play it like a Negro   There was too much grease on his hands   He got blood on the guitar   The midget danced around the campfire   I wanted to cut his throat   The dog bayed at the moon   And the blue Andalusian rooster played with a snake   I was bleeding out my nose   The fish bandits loaded the hog on Baby Gauge’s horse   They threw blood on the fire   And filled the bucket up with guts for fish bait   When they rode off I yelled “Peckerwoods”   I dreamed I saw Holy Ghost walking around the campfire   He was a wild hog with blood on his tushes   Along about midnight I heard a boat       but no rowing   Somebody short came walking out of the woods   With a light on his head   The light went out I couldn’t see   He drew something out of his boot   He grabbed me by the hair   I saw a knife in the moonlight   “Sweet Jesus” I said   Born In The Camp With Six Toes cut me down   IV   Chainsaw   The man cut his hand off at dawn   I heard him yell   I set up in bed   He ran past the window   “Don’t let the dog get it” he said   I got out of bed   I had the long handles on   It was cold   I threw some wood on the fire   I put the dime around my ankle   I put my boots on   I put a knife in the boot   I walked out to the road   The blue Andalusian rooster followed me   It was dark   I heard the chainsaw in the woods   I heard him singing all night   He was cutting firewood   He was drunk   The dog quit barking   I drew the knife out of my boot   I looked for the midget   I saw the blood and I tracked it   I saw the sun and the moon   I saw the snake doctors riding each other   The hand was in the sawdust   It was moving   The hambone was on the finger   It was morning   The dog didn’t get it   I did   There was blood on the chainsaw   I told the blue rooster   “He thought it was a guitar”   I walked around the hand seven times   I poked it with a stick   I sung to it   I picked it up like a snake   I took the hambone off the finger   I put Holy Ghost’s bone in my boot   I put the hand on a stump   I danced on the hand   I peed on it   I broke a wine bottle over it   I threw it up in the air and a hawk       hit it   The dog licked the blood out of the dust   I saw the fish bandit’s guitar   The blue rooster pecked it   I beat the hand with it   I threw the guitar in the river   The snake doctors lit on it   It floated away   I went down to the bank   I got a pole   I put a hook through the hand   I washed it off   When I touched the wound with my knife       it rolled up in a fist   Somebody came by in a boat   They held up a big fish   So I held up the hand   They jumped out of the boat   They thought I crossed them   One of them said “That wasn’t no hoodoo, was it”   It was Baby Gauge   I said “No, it was the guitar player’s hand”   They swam to the bank   I told them how I came by it   Born In The Camp With Six Toes said “It won’t   Take another fish off my lines”   I asked them “You want to shake it”   Baby Gauge said “No, I want to spit on it”   We spit on the hand   They left   I wrapped it up in newspaper like fish   I took it home   I put it under Jimmy’s pillow   and he knocked my teeth out   I put it in a cigar box with a picture         of Elvis Presley   I took it to town   I walked over to the dance hall   The guitar player was bleeding in the back of the pickup   I gave him the cigar box   He passed out   The midget pulled a knife on me   I picked up the hand   He ran off   On the way home I ran folks off the road   When the truck came by the house   The guitar player raised up in the bed   He said “Give me my hand back”   When it was dark   I tied fish line to it and hung it       in the outhouse   I sung to it   The moon shined through the chink hole   on the hand   I took it down   I threw it in a yellow jacket nest   I stomped on it   I took it to the palm reader   I said “Sister, read this”   A lot of evenings I listened for them   I knew they would come back   When a stranger got a drink at night   I thought it was the Holy Ghost   And sometimes a cloud went by like a three-legged dog   And the thunder was someone with a shotgun   Letting him have it   Now the moon was a fifty-cent piece   It was a belly I wanted         to cut open   When the flies got bad   I kept the hand in the smokehouse   V   Swimming at Night   The midget ran his finger across his neck   The other one said “Give it back”   I waited in the outhouse   I had a sawed-off shotgun   The men rode off   In the afternoon they sold fish   They cleaned them at the pump   The scales dried up on their faces   They loaded the meat on stolen horses   At night they rode up shooting pistols   I slept with an ice pick under my pillow   One night they rode up drunk   The midget was sitting in the guitar player’s lap   He said “Come on out”   They tied a bale of hay to Baby Gauge’s horse   They poured coal oil on it   They set it on fire   They laughed   The horse with the moon eye pranced around them   He galloped home   I carved wild hog out of a cypress knee   I made it the handle   I made four tushes out of the hambone   I used the blade I brought out of the fire   And sealed the pig with   It was the blade I put the burning horse to sleep with   I called the knife the Holy Ghost   To make me go crazy   I took all my clothes off   And jumped down the hole in the outhouse   I grabbed the yellow jacket nest   And held it over my heart   I pumped cold water over myself   And wallowed in the mud   I walked through the snake den barefooted   I swam the river at midnight   With the hand and a blue feather in my mouth   And the Holy Ghost around my neck   And the hooks caught in my arms    they caught in my legs   I cut the trot lines in two   I saw the guitar player stealing the fish   I was swimming beneath the shack   Under the sleeping midget   With the fish bandit’s hand in my mouth   I climbed through the trap door   I crawled under the bed   I cut the hooks out   I believe I was snake bit   I put the hand in the slop jar   I reached up and tickled his nose with the feather   He got out of bed   He turned the lights on   He let down his pants   He reached under the bed for the slop jar   He took the lid off   He screamed   I brought the knife across his leg   I hamstrung the midget   I swam under the water   With the hand in my mouth   I came up near the guitar player’s boat   He was running the lines   I swam to the other end of the trot line   I put the hand on a hook   I jerked the lines like a big fish   The guitar player worked his way down   He thought he had a good one   I let go of the line   He saw his left hand   He screamed   He fell out of the boat   I swam back through the river   I buried the knife in the levee   I was sleeping in the Negro’s lap   He was spitting snuff on my wounds   Born In The Camp With Six Toes cut me with a knife   Baby Gauge sucked the poison out   Oh Sweet Jesus the levees that break in my heart   
   My grandmother said when she was young   The grass was so wild and high   You couldn’t see a man on horseback.   In the fields she made out   Three barns,   Dark and blown down from the weather   Like her husbands.   She remembers them in the dark,   Cursing the beasts,   And how they would leave the bed   In the morning,   The dead grass of their eyes   Stacked against her.   
   When a man knows another man   Is looking for him   He doesn’t hide.   He doesn’t wait   To spend another night   With his wife   Or put his children to sleep.   He puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit   And goes to the barber shop   To let another man shave him.   He shuts his eyes   Remembers himself as a boy   Lying naked on a rock by the water.   Then he asks for the special lotion.   The old men line up by the chair   And the barber pours a little   In each of their hands.   
   It was Sunday, before dinner.   My uncles were listening to the opera.   O.Z. and I carried my brother in   And laid him on the table.   The women started screaming.   My brother raised up on his side   With dried blood on his hands,   We killed those goddamn Canale brothers   And nobody is ever going to touch us!   The men shut their eyes and danced.   We drank until morning   When everything was quiet.   They wiped their eyes, kissed us goodbye and left.   
   A guy comes walking out of the garden   Playing Dark Eyes on the accordian.   We’re sitting on the porch,   Drinking and spitting, lying.   We shut our eyes, snap our fingers.   Dewhurst goes out to his truck   Like he doesn’t believe what he’s seeing   And brings back three-half-pints.   A little whirlwind occurs in the road,   Carrying dust away like a pail of water.   We’re drinking serious now, and O.Z.   Wants to break in the store for some head cheese,   But the others won’t let him.   Everybody laughs, dances.   The crossroads are all quiet   Except for the little man on the accordian.   Things are dying down, the moon spills its water.   Dewhurst says he smells rain.   O.Z. says if it rains he’ll still make a crop.   We wait there all night, looking for rain.   We haven’t been to sleep, so the blue lizards   On the side of the white porch   Lose their tails when we try to dream.   The man playing the music looks at us,   Noticing what we’re up to. He backs off,   Holding up his hands in front, smiling,   Shaking his head, but before he gets half way   Down the road that O.Z. shoots him in the belly.   All summer his accordian rotted in the ditch,   Like an armadillo turning into a house payment.   
   at night while the dogs   were barking   Baby Gauge and I crawled under the fence   with knives   we made out like the rattlesnake melons   were men we didn’t like   the new moon ones were wolves   I would cut a belly this way   he would cut a belly that way   the flies   came around the sweet juice   it was blood to us   we tasted it we licked it off the blades   we decided not to kill the wolves   we wanted to be wolves   we stuck the knives in the ground   the moon shined on them   we turned the pilot caps inside out   so the fur would show   that way when we crawled   under the bob wire   a little piece would get caught   we wouldn’t though   we wanted to leave trails   but no scents   we tore the melons open we licked the blood off our paws   we wanted to be wolves   and in the morning all those dead men   with their hearts eat out   
   Sometimes in our sleep we touch   The body of another woman   And we wake up   And we know the first nights   With summer visitors   In the three storied house of our childhood.   Whatever we remember,   The darkest hair being brushed   In front of the darkest mirror   In the darkest room.      
   They caught them.   They were sitting at a table in the kitchen.   It was early.   They had on bathrobes.   They were drinking coffee and smiling.   She had one of his cigarillos in her fingers.   She had her legs tucked up under her in the chair.   They saw them through the window.   She thought of them stepping out of a bath   And him wrapping cloth around her.   He thought of her waking up in a small white building,   He thought of stones settling into the ground.   Then they were gone.   Then they came in through the back.   Her cat ran out.   The house was near the road.   She didn’t like the cat going out.   They stayed at the table.   The others were out of breath.   The man and the woman reached across the table.   They were afraid, they smiled.   The others poured themselves the last of the coffee   Burning their tongues.   The man and the woman looked at them.   They didn’t say anything.   The man and the woman moved closer to each other,   The round table between them.   The stove was still on and burned the empty pot.   She started to get up.   One of them shot her.   She leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons.   She thought about being beside him, being asleep.   They took her long grey socks   Put them over the barrel of a rifle   And shot him.   He went back in his chair, holding himself.   She told him hers didn’t hurt much,   Like in the fall when everything you touch   Makes a spark.   He thought about her getting up in the dark   Wrapping a quilt around herself   And standing in the doorway.   She asked the men if they shot them again   Not to hurt their faces.   One of them lit him one of his cigarettes.   He thought what it would be like   Being children together.   He was dead before he finished it.   She asked them could she take it out of his mouth.   So it wouldn’t burn his lips.   She reached over and touched his hair.   She thought about him walking through the dark singing.   She died on the table like that,   Smoke coming out of his mouth.   
   I am afraid after reading all these so-called initiation books that some   cortege of boot lickers will enter my room while I am sleeping and suck   my eyes out with soda straws they will be older men and women much like   the amanuenses with bad breath in the principal’s office who call   up and tell on you the Unferths of the world better beware   I know Jesus would have kicked your teeth in you couldn’t pull that shit on him   he was telling his buddies one night boys I’m glad y’all decided to come on up   and eat supper with me I hadn’t got much there’s a few things I’d like to say   at this time Matthew says to Simon I sure as hell don’t know what he’s got us   here this time for I’m beginning to wonder you talked to him lately   yea I was shooting the shit with him on the mountain but I want to tell you   this Matthew don’t never come up on him when he’s alone he jumped on me   I thought he was going to kill me he was just walking around just talking   to himself waving his arms like he does he’s worse than John      Jude put his hand up to his mouth and said down the table I think Jesus is going   off his rocker get Simon to tell you what he asked me   Simon says he didn’t want to talk about politics or dreams or nothing he just said   Jude next time y’all are over in Mesopotamia why don’t you pick me up a few      bottles of that wine they make over there   sure thing Jesus I says   well now the boss is talking he is saying I asked y’all up here because frankly   I’ve been feeling a little sick lately and I want to make sure y’all know what   to do in case anything happens I know one of you is going to do me in I know   that but goddamnit y’all know those people in town are after my ass   the other night I walked down the streets in a disguise and I seen a couple   of you messing around and drinking with the soldiers what’s going to happen   if one of you gets drunk and lets it slip where I’m hiding out then I’ll   be in a fix you know if they was to find me they going to cut me y’all ever   think about that and Peter ain’t you ever going to get it straight what you’re   supposed to do give me one of those biscuits Judas and go outside and take a      look-see I got you Jesus Judas says   John leans over he says been catching any fish Peter   oh well I been getting a few of a morning they ain’t biting too good now you know   on account of this blamed weather nobody is even listening to Jesus he’s just   talking to himself like he was crazy Matthew says I believe he’s been hitting   that wine a little too hard don’t you reckon   Jesus says another thing I told all of you it’d be better if you didn’t get   involved with women   now just listen to that little two-faced bastard James the Lesser says   we all know what he’s up to shacking up with all those town girls   the other night he was dressed fit to kill and drunk as six hundred dollars   a rolling around in the mud like a hog kissing that whore’s foot why shit   I wish he’d let us in on what he really does   Thomas spoke up for once he says I know what you mean the other day Andrew   and I asked him about some scripture he said leave me alone I don’t know   nothing about that shit and then we seen him cussing out a priest over at the      temple he knew more about it than the elder did   another thing Matthew says I wish he’d start writing what he wants done down   and do it so I can read it you know as well as I do that damned Peter can’t   keep it straight he won’t get anything right   Bartholomew says don’t make no difference atoll cause Paul is going to tell   it like he wants to that’s for damned sure   all the time Jesus just mumbling to himself wine spilt all over his robe   the rest of them chattering and cussing trying to figure him out   John the Baptist about the only one Jesus can count on except for crazy John      is banging his goblet on the table he is saying now ain’t this a sight   spitting in the lord’s face at his own birthday party I’ll swan   Brother John why don’t you tell Jesus what the real problem is   the crazy one says everyone of y’all is chickenshits you are afraid to look   those elders in the eye and tell them what you think ya’ll get up on a rock   to talk and you see a soldier coming and you say anybody seen a stray mule   Jesus is saying to himself I’m going to pull those temples down if I have to   get me a rope and tie it to a pillar and a jackass and do it myself   wake up Jesus Philip says   Paul who hadn’t touched a drop gets up and gets his paper out and says   the nature of the problem Jesus is this the people don’t believe you   those fellows in the temples have got it all organized all they have to do   is send out stooges and hire a couple of rednecks who make out like they’re   crippled they have a big gathering they say the same things you say they      pull off a fake healing the redneck’s wife stands up she says LIE he ain’t lame   he’s just drunk and so all the people go home saying those christians what a      bunch of wind see Jesus they are using your material but they ain’t coming   through so that is making you an enemy of the people we just got to get   organized as is proved here today by your followers carrying on as they did   so I’m getting sold down the river by the elders and their hirelings uh   that’s right Jesus ask anybody here why I didn’t think they’d do that he says   I told you a long time ago not to keep talking with them temple people John says   you should a know’d what they was up to ain’t nobody going to understand you   why you ought to know that when we first run on to you we had second thoughts   we thought you was crazy there’s probably still some sitting down here right      this second that still thinks you are a crazy one but Jesus you should a known   we been through a lot together we go a long way back you should a listened   all they wanted was you they liable to get you yet then they won’t have no   competition they want to keep feeding the hogs the same slop   they the ones that want to get fat man you listening to me Jesus   he says ok if that’s the way they want to do things at the temple   I’m going to change my tactics I going out after these chillun more than I have   been they’ll know I’m telling the truth I still got a few things up my sleeve   left what’s that Paul says   I’m going to do a few things can’t nobody follow   we could always go back to biting the heads off fish and chickens Peter says   why don’t you let us in on it for a change Paul says we follow you around   like we were a bunch of sheep picking up your tab bailing you out of jail   coming up here all the time for supper and what do we get to eat nothing   why can’t you have a little faith in us Jesus   ok this is what we going to do he says hold on who is that walking up the steps   it’s just Judas   how does it go boy Jesus says and the other one answers just fine Jesus just fine   and John the Baptist turns around he says to the one who has just slipped in boy   didn’t I see you talking to some white folks the other day   here endeth with a chord on the guitar that’s how the men did Jesus like he was   old like he was young just like Elvis did to Big Dad Arthur I know   just like another blind singer the men come down to see with their equipment   they get his song they pay him twenty dollars and he don’t hear from them ever   again except sometimes in the mail on Christmas when one of them might send a      five dollar check there won’t nobody cash oh tell me brother how do the old men   feel who were young as purple flowers from Hawaii once when they listen to their   songs coming in over a borrowed radio tell me don’t they take up a notch in they belt   don't they tie

sung shake they leg on the Television   I want to know Jesus don’t a blind man count no more some by signs others by   whispers some with a kiss and some with a gun and some with a six bit fountain   pen whoa lord help me and my brother help us get through this tookover land   
   There are many people who come back   After the doctor has smoothed the sheet   Around their body   And left the room to make his call.   They die but they live.   They are called the dead who lived through their deaths,   And among my people   They are considered wise and honest.   They float out of their bodies   And light on the ceiling like a moth,   Watching the efforts of everyone around them.   The voices and the images of the living   Fade away.   A roar sucks them under   The wheels of a darkness without pain.   Off in the distance   There is someone   Like a signalman swinging a lantern.   The light grows, a white flower.   It becomes very intense, like music.   They see the faces of those they loved,   The truly dead who speak kindly.   They see their father sitting in a field.   The harvest is over and his cane chair is mended.   There is a towel around his neck,   The odor of bay rum.   Then they see their mother   Standing behind him with a pair of shears.   The wind is blowing.   She is cutting his hair.   The dead have told these stories   To the living.   
   Sitting perfectly upright, contented and pensive, she holds in one hand, loosely, the reins of summer:the green of trees and bushes; the blue of lake water; the red of her jacket and open collar; the brownof her pinned-up hair, and her horse, deep in the yellow of sunflowers.When she stops to rest, summer rests. When she decides to leave, there goes summerover the hill.
