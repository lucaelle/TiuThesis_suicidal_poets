Poem
"   When you, that at this moment are to me   Dearer than words on paper, shall depart,   And be no more the warder of my heart,   Whereof again myself shall hold the key;   And be no more—what now you seem to be—   The sun, from which all excellences start   In a round nimbus, nor a broken dart   Of moonlight, even, splintered on the sea;   I shall remember only of this hour—   And weep somewhat, as now you see me weep—   The pathos of your love, that, like a flower,   Fearful of death yet amorous of sleep,   Droops for a moment and beholds, dismayed,   The wind whereon its petals shall be laid.       "
"   Pity me not because the light of day   At close of day no longer walks the sky;   Pity me not for beauties passed away   From field and thicket as the year goes by;   Pity me not the waning of the moon,   Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,   Nor that a man’s desire is hushed so soon,   And you no longer look with love on me.   This have I known always: Love is no more   Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,   Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore,   Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:   Pity me that the heart is slow to learn   What the swift mind beholds at every turn.   "
"   Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word!   Give back my book and take my kiss instead.   Was it my enemy or my friend I heard,   “What a big book for such a little head!”   Come, I will show you now my newest hat,   And you may watch me purse my mouth and prink!   Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that.   I never again shall tell you what I think.   I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly;   You will not catch me reading any more:   I shall be called a wife to pattern by;   And some day when you knock and push the door,   Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy,   I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me.       "
"   I shall go back again to the bleak shore   And build a little shanty on the sand,   In such a way that the extremest band   Of brittle seaweed will escape my door   But by a yard or two; and nevermore   Shall I return to take you by the hand;   I shall be gone to what I understand,   And happier than I ever was before.   The love that stood a moment in your eyes,   The words that lay a moment on your tongue,   Are one with all that in a moment dies,   A little under-said and over-sung.   But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies   Unchanged from what they were when I was young.   "
"   Loving you less than life, a little less   Than bitter-sweet upon a broken wall   Or brush-wood smoke in autumn, I confess   I cannot swear I love you not at all.   For there is that about you in this light—   A yellow darkness, sinister of rain—   Which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight   To dwell on you, and dwell on you again.   And I am made aware of many a week   I shall consume, remembering in what way   Your brown hair grows about your brow and cheek   And what divine absurdities you say:   Till all the world, and I, and surely you,   Will know I love you, whether or not I do.       "
"   I, being born a woman and distressed   By all the needs and notions of my kind,   Am urged by your propinquity to find   Your person fair, and feel a certain zest   To bear your body’s weight upon my breast:   So subtly is the fume of life designed,   To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,   And leave me once again undone, possessed.   Think not for this, however, the poor treason   Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,   I shall remember you with love, or season   My scorn with pity,—let me make it plain:   I find this frenzy insufficient reason   For conversation when we meet again.   "
"   Still will I harvest beauty where it grows:   In coloured fungus and the spotted fog   Surprised on foods forgotten; in ditch and bog   Filmed brilliant with irregular rainbows   Of rust and oil, where half a city throws   Its empty tins; and in some spongy log   Whence headlong leaps the oozy emerald frog. . . .   And a black pupil in the green scum shows.   Her the inhabiter of divers places   Surmising at all doors, I push them all.   Oh, you that fearful of a creaking hinge   Turn back forevermore with craven faces,   I tell you Beauty bears an ultra fringe   Unguessed of you upon her gossamer shawl!       "
"   Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.   Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,   And lay them prone upon the earth and cease   To ponder on themselves, the while they stare   At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere   In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese   Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release   From dusty bondage into luminous air.   O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,   When first the shaft into his vision shone   Of light anatomized! Euclid alone   Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they   Who, though once only and then but far away,   Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.   "
"   The white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish   Upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke   She knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish   For comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke   And scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire   Broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.   Then, softly stepping forth from her desire,   (Being mindful of like passion hurled in vain   Upon a similar task, in other days)   She thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,   Bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole   Of her still body. . . there sprang a little blaze. . .   A pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue!—   And the blue night stood flattened against the window,        staring through.       "
"   She had forgotten how the August night   Was level as a lake beneath the moon,   In which she swam a little, losing sight   Of shore; and how the boy, who was at noon   Simple enough, not different from the rest,   Wore now a pleasant mystery as he went,   Which seemed to her an honest enough test   Whether she loved him, and she was content.   So loud, so loud the million crickets’ choir. . .   So sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late. . .   And if the man were not her spirit’s mate,   Why was her body sluggish with desire?   Stark on the open field the moonlight fell,   But the oak tree’s shadow was deep and black and        secret as a well.       "
"                                I drew solitude over me, on the long shore.                                            —Robinson Jeffers, “Prelude”                   For whoever does not afflict his soul through this day, shall be              cut off from his people.                                                                               —Leviticus 23:29               What is a Jew in solitude?   What would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid   far from your own or those you have called your own?   What is a woman in solitude:   a queer woman or man?   In the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert   what in this world as it is can solitude mean?       The glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs   with its electric gate, its perfected privacy   is not what I mean   the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in Utah or the Golan Heights   is not what I mean   the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen   is not what I mean       Three thousand miles from what I once called home   I open a book searching for some lines I remember   about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once   bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,   something that bloomed and faded and was written down   in the poet’s book, forever:   Opening the poet’s book   I find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . . the hateful-eyedand human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them       Robinson Jeffers, multitude   is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys   and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines   are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey Pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,   and the separate persons, stooped   over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest   who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams   Hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other   Must I argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend   a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have I a choice?       To wonder far from your own or those you have called your own   to hear strangeness calling you from far away   and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk   to go to meet the Stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind   (the Jew on the icy, rutted road on Christmas Eve prays for another Jew   the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:   Make those be a woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)       Find someone like yourself.   Find others.   Agree you will never desert each other.   Understand that any rift among you   means power to those who want to do you in.   Close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.   But I have a nightmare to tell:   I am trying to say   that to be with my people is my dearest wish   but that I also love strangers   that I crave separateness   I hear myself stuttering these words   to my worst friends and my best enemies   who watch for my mistakes in grammar   my mistakes in love.   This is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?   If a cloud knew loneliness and fear, I would be that cloud.       To love the Stranger, to love solitude—am I writing merely about privilege   about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,   a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is,   who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car   into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death   young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his Blackness   Jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   Jew who has turned her back   on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone   found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as Jew?)       Solitude, O taboo, endangered species   on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, I want a gun to defend you   In the desert, on the deserted street, I want what I can’t have:   your elder sister, Justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread   her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true        And I ask myself, have I thrown courage away?   have I traded off something I don’t name?   To what extreme will I go to meet the extremist?   What will I do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision   far from the protection of those she has called her own?   Will I find O solitude   your plumes, your breasts, your hair   against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s   singing Yes, you are loved, why else this song?   in the old places, anywhere?       What is a Jew in solitude?   What is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?   When the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea   when leviathan is endangered and Jonah becomes revenger   when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded   when our souls crash together, Arab and Jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes   when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city   when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude   in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?       1984-1985   "
"   1.   It unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward.  All the stories   come folding out.  The smells and flowers begin to come back, as   the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded.  Rabbits and violets.   Who asked you to come over?  She got her foot in the door and   would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly.  Gas leak?   that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had   better check with the landlord.                                                               This was no better than the   predicament I had just read about.  Now it was actually changing   before my eyes.  Sometimes it will come to a standstill though,   and finally the reflection can begin.   Selfless—that was the proposition.  Smiling and moving instantly   there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,   to be in a particular place.   2.   This time the mule gave its face away.  Take your cadillac   where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,   and enjoy a good bottle of rum.   Running on this way she used various modes of expression that   were current.  Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.   What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the   woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility   of her mind.  At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation   was built up.  Here through various regulated artificial conditions,   spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed   her ideal concept of nature.  The smell was overpowering.   All right then.  She had a thing about nature, from flower   show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.   A beauty of cultivation—in living?  Hastiness did not prevent   her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd   conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, “OH OH   the life I am entangled in.”  Four sides of it.                                                                                           Above was a paradisical   level, incompleted.  With working possibilities.   Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.   Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new   bedspread and color scheme for pillows.                                                                                  Taste treats were   unresponsive.  Glamor do’s were out.  Conversation was nil.   Languid   she could not even find a place to languish upon that was   fulfilling in its own way.                               So out of the lifelessness that was around her,   the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was   sprouting,   she thought, Why not fantasy?  Tugging at this character and   that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-   blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller.  Here the four   walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again.  “I ought   to tighten down and make sure I say exactly what I mean.”   And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch   economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way.  Use every   tidbit, usefully.  Once upon a time there was a princess who   had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the   coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.   The princess languished.  She was not sure where to sit to her best   advantage to enjoy herself the most.  She could not go in her mind   or out.  She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the   High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was   a princess.  She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of   eden, the coat spread around her.                                                                   No, that poor little house she   had built was a bore.  It’s better that it go up in flames, as it did.   She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers.   Some people took them and some people didn’t.   3.   I’m glad to get back.  I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.   Questioning myself all along the way.  Was I jumping on her because   her time had come to an end.  Indeed I pounded on his arm all night,   over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing   but their softness.  Me ME, and the time we might spend together,   reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.   My flippancy is gone.  Now I have started my secret life again,   in transition, reminding.  As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna   groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.   All over I was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.   It was a cold night out.  It was colder still between the airy gaps,   between blankets.                                        You can see she is thoughtful   as she draws the string to the bow.  Where to go indeed.  The   point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.   A sleeping angel or a sleeping troll?  I was rather proud of being   used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown   street.  Here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,   drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what I owed.   It was a lot, if I hesitated.  I choose to go on, saying this is the   way I go, owing nothing, being that kind of person.  Hung up?   That thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly   marked.  Certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential   core of feeling blooms in each encounter.  Lost under the weight   of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.   Thus unhappy, I don’t want it to be this way, and so forth.   Not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.   4.   We of course are in a family situation.  Anything I wish might   happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be   considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality   they possessed.   In the snow, the wood piled up underneath.  Oh those drifting   sensibilities.  At this point it is scarcely believable that people   gather and like each other.  Eating chocolate pudding, getting   in touch with some other sense of alikeness.  The form is no   longer obvious to me.  Whether they meander or are joined together   in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.                                                        I suspect that in this house, this   place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is   no real fear; the objects are old and I am not familiar with them,   only the sense that the Ghost or spirit world strikes you with   its familiarity, pleasurable fear.                                                              Here the familiar   is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected   lurk in the hall, into the room.  Pieces of leather, old silken fans   laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly   terror is the wrong combination of ignorance.  It contains its own   self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe.  100 pieces of voice   with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the   soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as—   I am never sure; Oh it’s that power   and disease of believing in the stale that doesn’t demand a real   climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.   5.   The night passes in night time.  The head moving to the shoulder,   the head rising with a frown.   In a firm voice, it doesn’t matter if the hair is flying from undue   spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces   appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a   lovely way to be rid of waste.   However, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have   fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which   refuses to sink.                                                                                     There once was a woman   who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was   always constant.  Why does one have to contend with that she said,   puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up   new coping modes of behavior.  If he behaved to me thus when he was   40, now that I am 30, I can hardly behave like that to those that are   20, and so forth.  There wasn’t any model except the one she built,   and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern.  This   offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.   6.   You can’t see them, all bundled up, all those that choose   to move other than where the distance seems appealing.  Knowledge   has no depth.  There isn’t any message to be spoken.   Wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no   point in laying its head down.  She ought to watch carefully.                                                                                The claws.  It could be   the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the   rose, doesn’t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.   What could it be all about?  The necessity to follow, balancing,   contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.   Just a little touch.  The leader cautioned further progression.   I could hardly listen to the music for long.  Now there   seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing   definite, of a fragmented nature.                                                                  Certainly I wished the best   for all.  The sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as I also in the   profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the   twisting statements grooving into the language building something   to listen to.  The dress made from silk.  Trusting was awkward   and not of a nature to ease any further building.  Whosoever   you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the   burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of   communication.   7.   I am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort.  However, as   dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from   a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.   Knowledge comes from what purported strike?  From that which cleanses,   and let us knot say “heart” but tissue.  Hopefully and helpfully I have   built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep.  Not for purposes   of letting in the cold.                                            However, I have found that not all blockaded   against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless   realm of the mushroom.  As much can be denied as the bilious sun   strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and   the head.  That is uncorraled ecstasy.  I call it enthusiasm, free energy.   But it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force   and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.                                                                                 As the pieces of the house   ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks.  Whether or   not to join in what I was half committed to see and do.   8.   At this point, when Jack picked up the pussy willow branches, I said   they can’t possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication   to an older Con Edison man.  The buildings were like the unexplored   garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth   from boxes left overnight.  Energy as limitless possibility, in   the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.   For example, if once I stop to realize what little gets through, I am   much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult   to find any interest in anything.  Good energy displaces bad karma.   And other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own   place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed   fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations   between.                       As I saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, I   forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from   something I have never seen; more possibly the components of what   every man views.  If this was a possibility, the rays from every person   converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without   any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between   the fifth and sixth rung.  This is the way people glow and pulse similar   to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until   I who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be   blocked on the way, although I turn back gladly, and will again swim   through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting’s compounded measure   is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths   calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition   or orifices, stomachs and legs.   I reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing   themselves.  She ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but   fuller.  Did you forget to wax and wane?  Her head was full of energy   brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious   into color, but no sense.  Sense was for the thinkers.  Here the thinkers   forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,   and those off worse could smoke.                                                                                             I had felt very   foolish when I leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and   his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the   way.  And I followed for certainly no one would follow me.  As the day   is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and   nature.  These words, like Nature, and Head, Thinking and Words,   repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off   sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition.  Light   was such an enormous possibility.  Taking sight into a frenzy, it was   possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for   ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street   where cars had gone by.                                                     I worried about certain characters: ones   that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but I was drawn to   them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?   As when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became   distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled   with the stuff of continuity.  The sorrow that each day sinks into the   infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and   does its rituals.  Memory has its own screen across the room to view   itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form   in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.                                                                     New York. January – March, 1967   "
"          In Tamalpais is a big crystal. An acquaintance told   me the story. A Miwok was giving his grandfather’s medicine   bag to the Kroeber Museum in Berkeley. He said this man   took him over the mountain Tamalpais, at a certain time   in the year. I believe it was about the time of the   Winter Solstice, because then the tides are really low.   They stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over   the mountain. On their way to the Bolinas Beach clam patch,   where there is a big rock way out there.                                                                               Go out to   the rock. Take out of the medicine bag the crystal   that matches the crystal in Tamalpais. And                                                 if your heart is not true                                                 if your heart is not true   when you tap the rock in the clam patch                                                               a little piece of it will fly off                                                      and strike you in the heart                             and strike you dead.   And that’s the first story I ever heard about Bolinas.   "
"                    The grasses are light brown                 and the ocean comes in                 long shimmering lines                 under the fleet from last night                 which dozes now in the early morning   Here and there horses graze                 on somebody’s acreage                                  Strangely, it was not my desire   that bade me speak in church to be released            but memory of the way it used to be in   careless and exotic play                  when characters were promises         then recognitions.  The world of transformation   is real and not real but trusting.                               Enough of these lessons?  I mean   didactic phrases to take you in and out of   love’s mysterious bonds?                         Well I myself am not myself              and which power of survival I speak   for is not made of houses.             It is inner luxury, of golden figures   that breathe like mountains do               and whose skin is made dusky by stars.   "
"   When I used to focus on the worries, everybody                         was ahead of me, I was the bottom                   of the totem pole,                 a largely spread squat animal.   How about a quick massage now, he said to me.   I don’t think it’s cool, I replied.   Oh, said he, after a pause, I should have waited                        for you to ask me.   The waves came in closer and closer.   When I fall into the gap of suspicion I am no longer here.   In this world that has got closed over by houses                          and networks, I fly out   from under the belly.     Life’s dizzy crown   of whirling lights, circles this head.    Pure   with wonder, hot   with wonder.    The streets become golden.     All   size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.   We are in easy understanding.   Scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.                                       It is memory.    As I search to find   this day’s sweet drifting.    The fog out to sea, the wind.       "

"   All I could see from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood; I turned and looked another way, And saw three islands in a bay. So with my eyes I traced the line  Of the horizon, thin and fine, Straight around till I was come Back to where I'd started from;  And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood.   Over these things I could not see; These were the things that bounded me; And I could touch them with my hand, Almost, I thought, from where I stand. And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short, and scarce at all.   But, sure, the sky is big, I said; Miles and miles above my head; So here upon my back I'll lie And look my fill into the sky. And so I looked, and, after all, The sky was not so very tall. The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, And—sure enough!—I see the top!  The sky, I thought, is not so grand; I 'most could touch it with my hand! And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky.   I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity.   I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,—nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul.   All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight  Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust.   And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all!   A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat.   No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God.   Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die.   Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust.   Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place.   The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.   How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me!   I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and—crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave.   I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,— A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown clear and blue again. And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,— I know not how such things can be!— I breathed my soul back into me.   Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead, and lives again. About the trees my arms I wound;   Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; I raised my quivering arms on high; I laughed and laughed into the sky, Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb Sent instant tears into my eyes; O God, I cried, no dark disguise Can e'er hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity!   Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, Nor speak, however silently, But my hushed voice will answer Thee. I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day; God, I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart!   The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky,— No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through. But East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart; And he whose soul is flat—the sky Will cave in on him by and by.      "

"   Not fierce and tender but sweet.  This is our impression of the soldiers.  We call our machine Aunt Pauline.  Fasten it fat, that is us, we say Aunt Pauline.  When we left Paris we had rain.  Not snow now nor that in between.  We did have snow then.  Now we are bold.  We are accustomed to it.  All the weights are measures.  By this we mean we know how much oil we use for the machine.                                                      *          *          *   Hurrah for America.  Here we met a Captain and take him part way.  A day's sun.  Is this Miss.  Yes indeed our mat.  We meant by this that we were always meeting people and that it was  pleasant.  We can thank you.  We thank you.  Soldiers of course spoke to us.  Come together.  Come to me there now.  They read on our van American Committee in aid of French wounded.  All of it is bit.  Bitter.  This is the way they say we do help.  In the meaning of bright.  Bright not light.  This comforts them when they speak to me. I often discuss America with them and what we hope to do. They listen well and say we hope so too.  We all do.                                                      *          *          *   This is apropros of the birthplace of Maréchal Joffre. We visited it and we have sent postal cards of it. The committee will be pleased.  It is not a bother to be a soldier.  I think kindly of that bother.  Can you say lapse.  Then think about it.  Indeed it is yet.  We are so pleased.  With the flag.  With the flag of sets.  Sets of color.  Do you like flags.  Blue flags smell sweetly.  Blue flags in a whirl.  We did this we had ribbon of the American flag and we cut it up and we gave each soldier one with a pin and they pinned it on and we were pleased and we received a charming letter from a telephonist at the front who heard from a friend in Perpignan that we were giving this bit of ribbon and he asked for some and we sent them and we hope that they are all living.  The wind blows.  And the automobile goes.  Can you guess boards.  Wood.  Naturally we think about wind because this country of Rousillon is the windiest corner in France. Also it is a great wine country.                                                      *          *          *   This is apropos of the fact that I always ask where they come from and then I am ashamed to say I don't know all the Departments but I am learning them.  In the meantime.  In the meantime we are useful.  That is what I mean to say.  In the meantime can you have beds. This means that knowing the number  of beds you begin to know the hospital.  Kindly call a brother.  What is a cure.  I speak french.  What one means.  I can call it in time.  By the way where are fish.  They all love fishing.  In that case are there any wonders.  Many wonders are women.  I could almost say that that was apropos of my cranking my machine.  And men too.  We smile.  In the way sentences.  He does not feel as we do.  But he did have the coat.  He blushed a little.  This is sometimes when they can't quite help themselves and they want to help us. We do not understand the weather. That astonishes me.  Camellias in Perpignan.  Camellias finish when roses begin.  Thank you in smiles.  In this way we go on. So far we have had no troubles yet and yet we do need material.  It is astonishing that those who have fought so hard and so well should pick yellow irises and fish in a stream.  And then a pansy.  I did not ask for it.  It smells.  A sweet smell.  With acacia.  Call it locusts.  Call it me.  I finish by saying that the french soldier is the person we should all help.   "
"   Here is a coast; here is a harbor;   here, after a meager diet of horizon, is some scenery;   impractically shaped and—who knows?—self-pitying mountains,   sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery,   with a little church on top of one. And warehouses,   some of them painted a feeble pink, or blue,   and some tall, uncertain palms. Oh, tourist,   is this how this country is going to answer you   and your immodest demands for a different world,   and a better life, and complete comprehension   of both at last, and immediately,   after eighteen days of suspension?   Finish your breakfast. The tender is coming,   a strange and ancient craft, flying a strange and brillant rag.   So that's the flag. I never saw it before.   I somehow never thought of there being a flag,   but of course there was, all along. And coins, I presume,   and paper money; they remain to be seen.   And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward,   myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen,   descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters   waiting to be loaded with green coffee beans.   Please, boy, do be more careful with that boat hook!   Watch out! Oh! It has caught Miss Breen's   skirt! There! Miss Breen is about seventy,   a retired police lieutenant, six feet tall,   with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression.   Her home, when she is at home, is in Glens Fall   s, New York. There. We are settled.   The customs officials will speak English, we hope,   and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes.   Ports are necessities, like postage stamps, or soap,   but they seldom seem to care what impression they make,   or, like this, only attempt, since it does not matter,   the unassertive colors of soap, or postage stamps—   wasting away like the former, slipping the way the latter   do when we mail the letteres we wrote on the boat,   either because the glue here is very inferior   or because of the heat. We leave Santos at once;   we are driving to the interior.

"   Of course we failed, by succeeding.   The fiery cherub becomes his smothering.   A greedy heart dives into a dream   Of power or truth, and wakes up middle-aged   In some committee room.   It is eating paper instead of God.   We two are one, my bird, this is a wedding.       When love was war, you swore you’d burn   Your life and die at thirty-five. I said good riddance,   Bright hairy boy, I will beat you, down,   Tear you to monkey shreds, survive like earth,   Owl-eyed, because I wanted to see everything   Black and permanent and kill you with your theories.   We used to wake up sweaty and entangled.       Thirty, home, and work. We cohabit in a functioning machine.   There is violence, somewhere else. Do we wish this? It occurs,   The flayed combatant, the dismembered child,   The instruments in the basement. We must wish it. See,   Between us is peace, our babies are plump,   I know you, I caress you, I fail you. My faith adheres   In nothing. Don’t leave me, don’t leave me.       "

"   In the old, scratched, cheap wood of the typing stand   there is a landscape, veined, which only a child can see   or the child’s older self, a poet,   a woman dreaming when she should be typing   the last report of the day. If this were a map,   she thinks, a map laid down to memorize   because she might be walking it, it shows   ridge upon ridge fading into hazed desert   here and there a sign of aquifers   and one possible watering-hole. If this were a map   it would be the map of the last age of her life,   not a map of choices but a map of variations   on the one great choice. It would be the map by which   she could see the end of touristic choices,   of distances blued and purpled by romance,   by which she would recognize that poetry   isn’t revolution but a way of knowing   why it must come. If this cheap, mass-produced   wooden stand from the Brooklyn Union Gas Co.,   mass-produced yet durable, being here now,   is what it is yet a dream-map   so obdurate, so plain,   she thinks, the material and the dream can join   and that is the poem and that is the late report.October/November 1987   "

"   From the tawny light   from the rainy nights   from the imagination finding   itself and more than itself   alone and more than alone   at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,      can you pull me   into December? a lowland   of space, perception of space   towering of shadows of clouds blown upon   clouds over                     new ground, new made   under heavy December footsteps? the only   way to live?"
"   The clouds as I see them, rising      urgently, roseate in the      mounting of somber power   surging in evening haste over      roofs and hermetic      grim walls—                             Last night   as if death had lit a pale light   in your flesh, your flesh   was cold to my touch, or not cold      but cool, cooling, as if the last traces      of warmth were still fading in you.   My thigh burned in cold fear where      yours touched it.   But I forced to mind my vision of a sky      close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move—   a sky of gray mist it appeared—   and how looking intently at it we saw   its gray was not gray but a milky white   in which radiant traces of opal greens,   fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again,   and how only then, seeing the color in the gray,      a field sprang into sight, extending   between where we stood and the horizon,   a field of freshest deep spiring grass      starred with dandelions,   green and gold   gold and green alternating in closewoven      chords, madrigal field.   Is death’s chill that visited our bed      other than what it seemed, is it      a gray to be watched keenly?   Wiping my glasses and leaning westward,      clearing my mind of the day’s mist and leaning      into myself to see   the colors of truth   I watch the clouds as I see them      in pomp advancing, pursuing      the fallen sun.   "
"   Though the road turn at last      to death’s ordinary door,      and we knock there, ready      to enter and it opens   easily for us,                        yet   all the long journey   we shall have gone in chains,      fed on knowledge-apples      acrid and riddled with grubs.   We taste other food that life,      like a charitable farm-girl,      holds out to us as we pass—   but our mouths are puckered,      a taint of ash on the tongue.   It’s not joy that we’ve lost—   wildfire, it flares   in dark or shine as it will.   What’s gone   is common happiness,   plain bread we could eat   with the old apple of knowledge.   That old one—it griped us sometimes,      but it was firm, tart,      sometimes delectable ...   The ashen apple of these days   grew from poisoned soil. We are prisoners      and must eat   our ration. All the long road   in chains, even if, after all,   we come to   death’s ordinary door, with time   smiling its ordinary   long-ago smile.   "
"   As the stores close, a winter light       opens air to iris blue,       glint of frost through the smoke       grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk.   As the buildings close, released autonomous          feet pattern the streets       in hurry and stroll; balloon heads       drift and dive above them; the bodies          aren't really there.   As the lights brighten, as the sky darkens,       a woman with crooked heels says to another woman          while they step along at a fair pace,       ""You know, I'm telling you, what I love best          is life. I love life! Even if I ever get       to be old and wheezy—or limp! You know?          Limping along?—I'd still ... """
"   The old wooden steps to the front door      where I was sitting that fall morning      when you came downstairs, just awake,      and my joy at sight of you (emerging      into golden day—                            the dew almost frost)   pulled me to my feet to tell you      how much I loved you:   those wooden steps   are gone now, decayed   replaced with granite,   hard, gray, and handsome.      The old steps live   only in me:   my feet and thighs   remember them, and my hands      still feel their splinters.   Everything else about and around that house   brings memories of others—of marriage,   of my son. And the steps do too: I recall   sitting there with my friend and her little son who died,      or was it the second one who lives and thrives?   And sitting there ‘in my life,’ often, alone or with my husband.   Yet that one instant,   your cheerful, unafraid, youthful, ‘I love you too,’      the quiet broken by no bird, no cricket, gold leaves      spinning in silence down without   any breeze to blow them,                                       is what twines itself   in my head and body across those slabs of wood      that were warm, ancient, and now   wait somewhere to be burnt.

"   Genial poets, pink-faced      earnest wits—   you have given the world      some choice morsels,   gobbets of language presented   as one presents T-bone steak   and Cherries Jubilee.      Goodbye, goodbye,                               I don’t care   if I never taste your fine food again,      neutral fellows, seers of every side.      Tolerance, what crimes   are committed in your name.   And you, good women, bakers of nicest bread,      blood donors. Your crumbs   choke me, I would not want   a drop of your blood in me, it is pumped      by weak hearts, perfect pulses that never      falter: irresponsive   to nightmare reality.   It is my brothers, my sisters,   whose blood spurts out and stops   forever   because you choose to believe it is not your business.   Goodbye, goodbye,   your poems   shut their little mouths,      your loaves grow moldy,      a gulf has split                        the ground between us,   and you won’t wave, you’re looking   another way.   We shan’t meet again—   unless you leap it, leaving      behind you the cherished      worms of your dispassion,      your pallid ironies,   your jovial, murderous,      wry-humored balanced judgment,   leap over, un-   balanced? ... then   how our fanatic tears   would flow and mingle      for joy ...

"   To tell the truth, those brick Housing Authority buildings   For whose loveliness no soul had planned,   Like random dominoes stood, worn out and facing each other,   Creating the enclosure that was our home.   Long basement corridors connected one house to another   And had a special smell, from old bicycles and baby carriages   In the storage rooms. The elevators   Were used by kissing teenagers.   The playground—iron swingchains, fences, iron monkey bars,   Iron seesaw handles, doubtless now rusted—   Left a strong iron smell on my hands and in the autumn air   And rang with cries. To me it is even precious   Where they chased the local Mongoloid, yelling “Stupid Joey! Stupid Joey!”   Now I’ve said everything nice I can about this.   "
"   They remember the dead who died in the resistance.      It is in sweet tones that they speak of them.      They shake their heads, still, after the dinner   Walking back to the car, while an evening snow      That has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,      Falls into streets that are already slushy.   They shake their heads, as we do when there is something      Too strange to believe,   Or as a beast does, stunned by a blow.   “To die in the resistance,”   they say, “is to fail      To turn into slush, to escape this ugliness.      It is at once to leap, a creamy swan,   Upward.”   Three voices: oboe, piano, cello.   The high one wishes to be pleasing, the middle      To be practical, the deep to persevere.   A movie theater lobby in front of them   Throws its light on the sidewalk, like a woman      Swiftly emptying a bucket of water:   The flakes are falling in its yellow light.      Then they pass a café, its light red neon,      Then a closed pharmacy.                                       —They pull sharp air   Into their lungs, a pain that is a pleasure.      “Try to live as if there were no God,”      They don’t say, but they mean.   A recollection of purity, a clean   Handkerchief each man feels in his own pocket,   Perturbs them, slows their pace down. Now they have seen   A yellow stain on a pile of old snow   Between two parked cars, where a man has peed:      The resistance. The falling flakes, falling   On the men’s hats. And now   The snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders.   "
"   Boil over—it’s what the nerves do,      Watch them seethe when stimulated,   Murmurs the man at the stove      To the one at the fridge—   Watch that electric impulse that finally makes them      Fume and fizz at either   Frayed end. If you could grasp a bundle   Of nerves in your fist like a jumper cable, and sense that   Python’s writhe, or a garden hose when the pressure’s      High and it wilfully weaves about   Trying its best to get away from you—   You’d see how nothing is passive,   We’re all—I mean from our elephant sun, ejaculant      Great-grandfather, cascading down   To weightless      Unstoppable neutrinos   Leaving their silvery trace      In vacuum chambers, in   Effervescent lines, twisted      Madly in our madhouse jackets,   Rules, laws, which we are seething to break      Though to rupture them might be of course to die,   Or, possibly,      To change:   Boil, it’s what water   And everything else teaches.

"   Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;      Eat I must, and sleep I will, — and would that night were here! But ah! — to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!      Would that it were day again! — with twilight near! Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;      This or that or what you will is all the same to me; But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, —      There's little use in anything as far as I can see. Love has gone and left me, — and the neighbors knock and borrow,      And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, — And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow      There's this little street and this little house.    "
"   Oh, come, my lad, or go, my lad,    And love me if you like! I hardly hear the door shut    Or the knocker strike. Oh, bring me gifts or beg me gifts,    And wed me if you will! I'd make a man a good wife,    Sensible and still. And why should I be cold, my lad,    And why should you repine, Because I love a dark head    That never will be mine? I might as well be easing you    As lie alone in bed And waste the night in wanting    A cruel dark head! You might as well be calling yours    What never will be his, And one of us be happy;    There's few enough as is.   "
"   It's little I care what path I take, And where it leads it's little I care, But out of this house, lest my heart break, I must go, and off somewhere! It's little I know what's in my heart, What's in my mind it's little I know, But there's that in me must up and start, And it's little I care where my feet go! I wish I could walk for a day and a night, And find me at dawn in a desolate place, With never the rut of a road in sight, Or the roof of a house, or the eyes of a face. I wish I could walk till my blood should spout, And drop me, never to stir again, On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out, And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain. But dump or dock, where the path I take Brings up, it's little enough I care, And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make, Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere.  ""Is something the matter, dear,"" she said,  ""That you sit at your work so silently?""  ""No, mother, no—'twas a knot in my thread.   There goes the kettle—I'll make the tea.""    "
"   I know what my heart is like       Since your love died: It is like a hollow ledge Holding a little pool       Left there by the tide,       A little tepid pool, Drying inward from the edge.   "
"   I Love, though for this you riddle me with darts, And drag me at your chariot till I die, — Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts! — Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie Who shout you mighty: thick about my hair, Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr, Who still am free, unto no querulous care A fool, and in no temple worshiper! I, that have bared me to your quiver's fire, Lifted my face into its puny rain, Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke Desire As you are Powerless to Elicit Pain! (Now will the god, for blasphemy so brave, Punish me, surely, with the shaft I crave!) II I think I should have loved you presently, And given in earnest words I flung in jest; And lifted honest eyes for you to see, And caught your hand against my cheek and breast; And all my pretty follies flung aside That won you to me, and beneath your gaze, Naked of reticence and shorn of pride, Spread like a chart my little wicked ways. I, that had been to you, had you remained, But one more waking from a recurrent dream, Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained, And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme, A ghost in marble of a girl you knew Who would have loved you in a day or two. III Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow! Faithless am I save to love's self alone. Were you not lovely I would leave you now: After the feet of beauty fly my own. Were you not still my hunger's rarest food, And water ever to my wildest thirst, I would desert you — think not but I would! — And seek another as I sought you first. But you are mobile as the veering air, And all your charms more changeful than the tide, Wherefore to be inconstant is no care: I have but to continue at your side. So wanton, light and false, my love, are you, I am most faithless when I most am true. IV I shall forget you presently, my dear, So make the most of this, your little day, Your little month, your little half a year, Ere I forget, or die, or move away, And we are done forever; by and by I shall forget you, as I said, but now, If you entreat me with your loveliest lie I will protest you with my favorite vow. I would indeed that love were longer-lived, And vows were not so brittle as they are, But so it is, and nature has contrived To struggle on without a break thus far, — Whether or not we find what we are seeking Is idle, biologically speaking.

"   Time does not bring relief; you all have lied      Who told me time would ease me of my pain!      I miss him in the weeping of the rain;      I want him at the shrinking of the tide;   The old snows melt from every mountain-side,      And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane;      But last year’s bitter loving must remain   Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide.      There are a hundred places where I fear      To go,—so with his memory they brim.      And entering with relief some quiet place      Where never fell his foot or shone his face      I say, “There is no memory of him here!”      And so stand stricken, so remembering him.   "

Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,   Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,   Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:   I cannot say what loves have come and gone,   I only know that summer sang in me   A little while, that in me sings no more.

"   A new volcano has erupted,   the papers say, and last week I was reading      where some ship saw an island being born:      at first a breath of steam, ten miles away;      and then a black fleck—basalt, probably—   rose in the mate’s binoculars   and caught on the horizon like a fly.   They named it. But my poor old island’s still      un-rediscovered, un-renamable.   None of the books has ever got it right.   Well, I had fifty-two   miserable, small volcanoes I could climb      with a few slithery strides—   volcanoes dead as ash heaps.   I used to sit on the edge of the highest one      and count the others standing up,   naked and leaden, with their heads blown off.      I’d think that if they were the size      I thought volcanoes should be, then I had      become a giant;   and if I had become a giant,   I couldn’t bear to think what size      the goats and turtles were,   or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers      —a glittering hexagon of rollers      closing and closing in, but never quite,      glittering and glittering, though the sky      was mostly overcast.   My island seemed to be   a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere’s      left-over clouds arrived and hung   above the craters—their parched throats      were hot to touch.   Was that why it rained so much?   And why sometimes the whole place hissed?      The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,      hissing like teakettles.   (And I’d have given years, or taken a few,      for any sort of kettle, of course.)   The folds of lava, running out to sea,   would hiss. I’d turn. And then they’d prove      to be more turtles.   The beaches were all lava, variegated,      black, red, and white, and gray;   the marbled colors made a fine display.      And I had waterspouts. Oh,   half a dozen at a time, far out,   they’d come and go, advancing and retreating,      their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches      of scuffed-up white.   Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,      sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched      the water spiral up in them like smoke.      Beautiful, yes, but not much company.   I often gave way to self-pity.   “Do I deserve this? I suppose I must.   I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Was there      a moment when I actually chose this?   I don’t remember, but there could have been.”      What’s wrong about self-pity, anyway?   With my legs dangling down familiarly      over a crater’s edge, I told myself   “Pity should begin at home.” So the more      pity I felt, the more I felt at home.   The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun      rose from the sea,   and there was one of it and one of me.      The island had one kind of everything:      one tree snail, a bright violet-blue   with a thin shell, crept over everything,      over the one variety of tree,   a sooty, scrub affair.   Snail shells lay under these in drifts      and, at a distance,   you’d swear that they were beds of irises.      There was one kind of berry, a dark red.      I tried it, one by one, and hours apart.      Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;      and so I made home-brew. I’d drink      the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff   that went straight to my head   and play my home-made flute   (I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)      and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.      Home-made, home-made! But aren’t we all?      I felt a deep affection for   the smallest of my island industries.      No, not exactly, since the smallest was      a miserable philosophy.   Because I didn’t know enough.   Why didn’t I know enough of something?      Greek drama or astronomy? The books      I’d read were full of blanks;   the poems—well, I tried   reciting to my iris-beds,   “They flash upon that inward eye,   which is the bliss ...” The bliss of what?      One of the first things that I did   when I got back was look it up.   The island smelled of goat and guano.      The goats were white, so were the gulls,      and both too tame, or else they thought      I was a goat, too, or a gull.Baa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek,   baa ... shriek ..."

When Amos began to pray      even in the store and   finally the family had   to put him away.   “Yes ...” that peculiar      affirmative. “Yes ...”   A sharp, indrawn breath,      half groan, half acceptance,      that means “Life’s like that.      We know it (also death).”   Talking the way they talked      in the old featherbed,      peacefully, on and on,   dim lamplight in the hall,      down in the kitchen, the dog      tucked in her shawl.   Now, it’s all right now      even to fall asleep   just as on all those nights.      —Suddenly the bus driver      stops with a jolt,   turns off his lights.   A moose has come out of   the impenetrable wood   and stands there, looms, rather,      in the middle of the road.   It approaches; it sniffs at   the bus’s hot hood.   Towering, antlerless,      high as a church,   homely as a house   (or, safe as housessafe as houses Totally safe).   A man’s voice assures us      “Perfectly harmless....”   Some of the passengers      exclaim in whispers,      childishly, softly,   “Sure are big creatures.”      “It’s awful plain.”      “Look! It’s a she!”   Taking her time,   she looks the bus over,      grand, otherworldly.      Why, why do we feel      (we all feel) this sweet      sensation of joy?   “Curious creatures,”   says our quiet driver,      rolling his r’s.   “Look at that, would you.”      Then he shifts gears.   For a moment longer,   by craning backward,      the moose can be seen   on the moonlit macadammacadam Road, pavement;      then there’s a dim   smell of moose, an acridacrid Pungent, irritating      smell of gasoline.

Such passion—   rage or joy?                                 Thus, not mild, not temperate,   God’s love for the world. Vast   flood of mercy                         flung on resistance.   "
"   Two girls discover      the secret of life      in a sudden line of      poetry.   I who don’t know the      secret wrote      the line. They      told me   (through a third person)      they had found it   but not what it was      not even   what line it was. No doubt      by now, more than a week      later, they have forgotten      the secret,   the line, the name of      the poem. I love them      for finding what      I can’t find,   and for loving me      for the line I wrote,      and for forgetting it      so that   a thousand times, till death      finds them, they may      discover it again, in other      lines   in other      happenings. And for      wanting to know it,      for   assuming there is      such a secret, yes,      for that      most of all.   "

"   A violent luck and a whole sample and even then quiet.   Water is squeezing, water is almost squeezing on lard. Water, water is a mountain and it is selected and it is so practical that there is no use in money. A mind under is exact and so it is necessary to have a mouth and eye glasses.   A question of sudden rises and more time than awfulness is so easy and shady. There is precisely that noise.   A peck a small piece not privately overseen, not at all not a slice, not at all crestfallen and open, not at all mounting and chaining and evenly surpassing, all the bidding comes to tea.   A separation is not tightly in worsted and sauce, it is so kept well and sectionally.   Put it in the stew, put it to shame. A little slight shadow and a solid fine furnace.   The teasing is tender and trying and thoughtful.   The line which sets sprinkling to be a remedy is beside the best cold.   A puzzle, a monster puzzle, a heavy choking, a neglected Tuesday.   Wet crossing and a likeness, any likeness, a likeness has blisters, it has that and teeth, it has the staggering blindly and a little green, any little green is ordinary.   One, two and one, two, nine, second and five and that.   A blaze, a search in between, a cow, only any wet place, only this tune.   Cut a gas jet uglier and then pierce pierce in between the next and negligence. Choose the rate to pay and pet pet very much. A collection of all around, a signal poison, a lack of languor and more hurts at ease.   A white bird, a colored mine, a mixed orange, a dog.   Cuddling comes in continuing a change.   A piece of separate outstanding rushing is so blind with open delicacy.   A canoe is orderly. A period is solemn. A cow is accepted.   A nice old chain is widening, it is absent, it is laid by.   "

"   The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.   Callous is something that hardening leaves behind what will be soft if there is a genuine interest in there being present as many girls as men. Does this change. It shows that dirt is clean when there is a volume.   A cushion has that cover. Supposing you do not like to change, supposing it is very clean that there is no change in appearance, supposing that there is regularity and a costume is that any the worse than an oyster and an exchange. Come to season that is there any extreme use in feather and cotton. Is there not much more joy in a table and more chairs and very likely roundness and a place to put them.   A circle of fine card board and a chance to see a tassel.   What is the use of a violent kind of delightfulness if there is no pleasure in not getting tired of it. The question does not come before there is a quotation. In any kind of place there is a top to covering and it is a pleasure at any rate there is some venturing in refusing to believe nonsense. It shows what use there is in a whole piece if one uses it and it is extreme and very likely the little things could be dearer but in any case there is a bargain and if there is the best thing to do is to take it away and wear it and then be reckless be reckless and resolved on returning gratitude.   Light blue and the same red with purple makes a change. It shows that there is no mistake. Any pink shows that and very likely it is reasonable. Very likely there should not be a finer fancy present. Some increase means a calamity and this is the best preparation for three and more being together. A little calm is so ordinary and in any case there is sweetness and some of that.   A seal and matches and a swan and ivy and a suit.   A closet, a closet does not connect under the bed. The band if it is white and black, the band has a green string. A sight a whole sight and a little groan grinding makes a trimming such a sweet singing trimming and a red thing not a round thing but a white thing, a red thing and a white thing.   The disgrace is not in carelessness nor even in sewing it comes out out of the way.   What is the sash like. The sash is not like anything mustard it is not like a same thing that has stripes, it is not even more hurt than that, it has a little top.    "

"   Openly, yes,          With the naturalness          Of the hippopotamus or the alligator When it climbs out on the bank to experience the  Sun, I do these Things which I do, which please          No one but myself.  Now I breathe and now I am sub-          Merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object In view was a Renaissance; shall I say          The contrary?  The sediment of the river which          Encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used To it, it may Remain there; do away          With it and I am myself done away with, for the          Patina of circumstance can but enrich what was There to begin With.

My soul shall never Be cut into By a wooden spear; through-          Out childhood to the present time, the unity of          Life and death has been expressed by the circumference Described by my Trunk; nevertheless, I          Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after          All; and I am on my guard; external poise, it Has its centre Well nurtured—we know          Where—in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where ?          My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of The wind.  I see And I hear, unlike the          Wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made          To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear, That tree trunk without   Roots, accustomed to shout          Its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact            By who knows what strange pressure of the  atmosphere; that   Spiritual   Brother to the coral          Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light          Becomes a nebulous green.

"   Man, looking into the sea— taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself— it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing but you cannot stand in the middle of this: the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave. The firs stand in a procession—each with an emerald turkey-foot at the top— reserved as their contours, saying nothing; repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea; the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look. There are others besides you who have worn that look— whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them for their bones have not lasted; men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave, and row quickly away—the blades of the oars   moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death. The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanx—beautiful under networks of foam, and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed; the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore— the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys, advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink— in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.

Whetted to brilliance by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is superior to opportunity, these things are rich instruments with which to experiment.

"   Brown gas-fog, white   beneath the street lamps.   Cut off on three sides, all space filled   with our bodies.          Bodies that stumble   in brown airlessness, whitened   in light, a mildew glare,          that stumble   hand in hand, blinded, retching.   Wanting it, wanting   to be here, the body believing it’s   dying in its nausea, my head   clear in its despair, a kind of joy,   knowing this is by no means death,   is trivial, an incident, a   fragile instant.    Wanting it, wanting             with all my hunger this anguish,             this knowing in the body   the grim odds we’re   up against, wanting it real.   Up that bank where gas   curled in the ivy, dragging each other   up, strangers, brothers   and sisters.    Nothing   will do but   to taste the bitter   taste. No life   other, apart from.   "
"   ‘That creep Tolstoy,’ she sobbed.   ‘He. . . He. . . couldn’t even. . .’   Something about his brother dying.   The serfs’ punishments   have not ceased to suppurate on their backs.   Woodlots. People. Someone crying   under the yellow   autumn birchgrove drove him   wild: A new set of resolves:   When gambling, that almost obsolete fever,   or three days with the gypsies   sparked him into pure ego, he could,   just the same, write home, ‘Sell them.’   It’s true. ‘Still,’ (someone who loved her said,   cold and firm while she dissolved,hypocrite, in self disgust, lectrice)   ‘Still, he kept on. He wrote   all that he wrote; and seems to have understood   better than most of us:   to be human isn’t easy. It’s not   easy to be a serf or a master and learn   that art. It takes nerve. Bastard. Fink.   Yet the grief   trudging behind his funeral, he earned.’   "
"   “Son,” said my mother,      When I was knee-high,    “You’ve need of clothes to cover you,      And not a rag have I.       “There’s nothing in the house      To make a boy breeches,   Nor shears to cut a cloth with      Nor thread to take stitches.       “There’s nothing in the house      But a loaf-end of rye,   And a harp with a woman’s head      Nobody will buy,”      And she began to cry.       That was in the early fall.      When came the late fall,    “Son,” she said, “the sight of you         Makes your mother’s blood crawl,—       “Little skinny shoulder-blades      Sticking through your clothes!   And where you’ll get a jacket from      God above knows.       “It’s lucky for me, lad,      Your daddy’s in the ground,   And can’t see the way I let      His son go around!”      And she made a queer sound.       That was in the late fall.      When the winter came,   I’d not a pair of breeches      Nor a shirt to my name.       I couldn’t go to school,      Or out of doors to play.   And all the other little boys      Passed our way.       “Son,” said my mother,      “Come, climb into my lap,   And I’ll chafe your little bones      While you take a nap.”       And, oh, but we were silly      For half an hour or more,   Me with my long legs      Dragging on the floor,       A-rock-rock-rocking      To a mother-goose rhyme!   Oh, but we were happy      For half an hour’s time!       But there was I, a great boy,      And what would folks say   To hear my mother singing me      To sleep all day,      In such a daft way?       Men say the winter      Was bad that year;   Fuel was scarce,      And food was dear.       A wind with a wolf’s head      Howled about our door,   And we burned up the chairs      And sat on the floor.       All that was left us      Was a chair we couldn’t break,   And the harp with a woman’s head      Nobody would take,      For song or pity’s sake.       The night before Christmas      I cried with the cold,   I cried myself to sleep      Like a two-year-old.       And in the deep night      I felt my mother rise,   And stare down upon me      With love in her eyes.       I saw my mother sitting      On the one good chair,   A light falling on her      From I couldn’t tell where,       Looking nineteen,      And not a day older,   And the harp with a woman’s head      Leaned against her shoulder.       Her thin fingers, moving      In the thin, tall strings,   Were weav-weav-weaving      Wonderful things.       Many bright threads,      From where I couldn’t see,   Were running through the harp-strings     Rapidly,       And gold threads whistling      Through my mother’s hand.   I saw the web grow,      And the pattern expand.       She wove a child’s jacket,      And when it was done   She laid it on the floor      And wove another one.       She wove a red cloak      So regal to see,    “She’s made it for a king’s son,”      I said, “and not for me.”      But I knew it was for me.       She wove a pair of breeches      Quicker than that!   She wove a pair of boots      And a little cocked hat.       She wove a pair of mittens,      She wove a little blouse,   She wove all night      In the still, cold house.       She sang as she worked,      And the harp-strings spoke;   Her voice never faltered,      And the thread never broke.      And when I awoke,—       There sat my mother      With the harp against her shoulder   Looking nineteen      And not a day older,       A smile about her lips,      And a light about her head,   And her hands in the harp-strings      Frozen dead.       And piled up beside her      And toppling to the skies,   Were the clothes of a king’s son,      Just my size.   "

"   A voice from the dark called out,                ‘The poets must give us   imagination of peace, to oust the intense, familiar   imagination of disaster. Peace, not only   the absence of war.’                                      But peace, like a poem,   is not there ahead of itself,   can’t be imagined before it is made,   can’t be known except   in the words of its making,   grammar of justice,   syntax of mutual aid.                                          A feeling towards it,   dimly sensing a rhythm, is all we have   until we begin to utter its metaphors,   learning them as we speak.                                                 A line of peace might appear   if we restructured the sentence our lives are making,   revoked its reaffirmation of profit and power,   questioned our needs, allowed   long pauses . . .                           A cadence of peace might balance its weight   on that different fulcrum; peace, a presence,   an energy field more intense than war,   might pulse then,   stanza by stanza into the world,   each act of living   one of its words, each word   a vibration of light—facets   of the forming crystal.

"   We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—   But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,   We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;   And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.   We were very tired, we were very merry—   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;   And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,   From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;   And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,   And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.   We were very tired, we were very merry,   We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.   We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,   And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;   And she wept, “God bless you!” for the apples and pears,   And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.

"   Come into animal presence.   No man is so guileless as   the serpent. The lonely white   rabbit on the roof is a star   twitching its ears at the rain.   The llama intricately   folding its hind legs to be seated   not disdains but mildly   disregards human approval.   What joy when the insouciant   armadillo glances at us and doesn't   quicken his trotting   across the track into the palm brush.   What is this joy? That no animal   falters, but knows what it must do?   That the snake has no blemish,   that the rabbit inspects his strange surroundings   in white star-silence? The llama   rests in dignity, the armadillo   has some intention to pursue in the palm-forest.   Those who were sacred have remained so,   holiness does not dissolve, it is a presence   of bronze, only the sight that saw it   faltered and turned from it.   An old joy returns in holy presence.

"   Matisse, too, when the fingers ceased to work,   Worked larger and bolder, his primary colors celebrating   The weddings of innocence and glory, innocence and glory   Monet when the cataracts blanketed his eyes   Painted swirls of rage, and when his sight recovered   Painted water lilies, Picasso claimedI do not seek, I find, and stuck to that story   About himself, and made that story stick.   Damn the fathers. We are talking about defiance.   "
"   Hypocrite women, how seldom we speak      of our own doubts, while dubiously      we mother man in his doubt!   And if at Mill Valley perched in the trees      the sweet rain drifting through western air      a white sweating bull of a poet told us   our cunts are ugly—why didn't we      admit we have thought so too? (And      what shame? They are not for the eye!)   No, they are dark and wrinkled and hairy,      caves of the Moon ...          And when a      dark humming fills us, a   coldness towards life,   we are too much women to      own to such unwomanliness.   Whorishly with the psychopomp      we play and plead—and say   nothing of this later.             And our dreams,   with what frivolity we have pared them      like toenails, clipped them like ends of      split hair.   "
"   I like to find      what's not found      at once, but lies   within something of another nature,      in repose, distinct.      Gull feathers of glass, hidden   in white pulp: the bones of squid      which I pull out and lay   blade by blade on the draining board—          tapered as if for swiftness, to pierce             the heart, but fragile, substance          belying design.               Or a fruit, mamey,   cased in rough brown peel, the flesh      rose-amber, and the seed:   the seed a stone of wood, carved and   polished, walnut-colored, formed      like a brazilnut, but large,   large enough to fill   the hungry palm of a hand.   I like the juicy stem of grass that grows   within the coarser leaf folded round,   and the butteryellow glow   in the narrow flute from which the morning-glory      opens blue and cool on a hot morning.

Eschatology is a word I learned   as a child: the study of Last Things;   facing my mirror—no longer young,          the news—always of death,          the dogs—rising from sleep and clamoring                  and howling, howling,   nevertheless   I see for a moment      that's not it: it is      the First Things.   Word after word   floats through the glass.      Towards me.   "
"   The red eyes of rabbits      aren't sad. No one passes   the sad golden village in a barge   any more. The sunset      will leave it alone. If the      curtains hang askew      it is no one's fault.   Around and around and around   everywhere the same sound      of wheels going, and things      growing older, growing      silent. If the dogs   bark to each other   all night, and their eyes      flash red, that's   nobody's business. They have      a great space of dark to      bark across. The rabbits      will bare their teeth at      the spring moon.   "
"   A doll's hair concealing      an eggshell skull delicately      throbbing, within which   maggots in voluptuous unrest      jostle and shrug. Oh, Eileen, my      big doll, your gold hair was      not more sunny than this   human fur, but   your head was   radiant in its emptiness,   a small clean room.   Her warm and rosy mouth   is telling lies—she would   believe them if she could believe:      her pretty eyes   search out corruption.

"   I had a little Sorrow,      Born of a little Sin, I found a room all damp with gloom      And shut us all within; And, ""Little Sorrow, weep,"" said I, ""And, Little Sin, pray God to die, And I upon the floor will lie      And think how bad I've been!"" Alas for pious planning —      It mattered not a whit! As far as gloom went in that room,      The lamp might have been lit! My Little Sorrow would not weep, My Little Sin would go to sleep — To save my soul I could not keep      My graceless mind on it! So up I got in anger,      And took a book I had, And put a ribbon on my hair      To please a passing lad.

"   To what purpose, April, do you return again? Beauty is not enough. You can no longer quiet me with the redness Of little leaves opening stickily. I know what I know. The sun is hot on my neck as I observe The spikes of the crocus. The smell of the earth is good. It is apparent that there is no death. But what does that signify? Not only under ground are the brains of men Eaten by maggots. Life in itself Is nothing, An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs. It is not enough that yearly, down this hill, April Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.    "

"            Written in A Moment of Exasperation            How can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: ""Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest."" I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end; ""Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are."" And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still.   "

"   The poet pursues his beautiful theme; The preacher his golden beatitude;     And I run after a vanishing dream—     The glittering, will-o’-the-wispish gleam Of the properly scholarly attitude— The highly desirable, the very advisable, The hardly acquirable, properly scholarly attitude.     I envy the savage without any clothes, Who lives in a tropical latitude;     It’s little of general culture he knows.     But then he escapes the worrisome woes Of the properly scholarly attitude— The unceasingly sighed over, wept over, cried over, The futilely died over, properly scholarly attitude.     I work and I work till I nearly am dead, And could say what the watchman said—that I could!     But still, with a sigh and a shake of the head,     “You don’t understand,” it is ruthlessly said, “The properly scholarly attitude— The aye to be sought for, wrought for and fought for, The ne’er to be caught for, properly scholarly attitude—”     I really am sometimes tempted to say That it’s merely a glittering platitude;     That people have just fallen into the way,     When lacking a subject, to tell of the sway Of the properly scholarly attitude— The easily preachable, spread-eagle speechable, In practice unreachable, properly scholarly attitude.

All of this never matters in authority But this which they need as they are alike   Or in an especial case they will fulfill Not only what they have at their instigation   Made for it as a decision in its entirety   Made that they minded as well as blinded   Lengthened for them welcome in repose   But which they open as a chance But made it be perfectly their allowance   All which they antagonise as once for all   Kindly have it joined as they mind

In their way not in their way it can be all arranged   Not now we are waiting.

Or is it at all likely that they arrange what they like.   Nohody knows just why they are or are not anxious      While they sit and watch the horse which rests   Not because he is tired but because they are waiting   To say will they wait with them in their way      Only to say it relieves them that they go away      This is what they feel when they like it   Most of them do or which   It is very often their need not to be either   Just why they are after all made quickly faster      Just as they might do.   It is what they did say when they mentioned it      Or this.   It is very well to go up and down and look more      Than they could please that they see where      It is better that they are there   
   Should they may be they might if they delight   In why they must see it be there not only necessarily      But which they might in which they might      For which they might delight if they look there      And they see there that they look there   To see it be there which it is if it is   Which may be where where it is   If they do not occasion it to be different   From what it is.   In one direction there is the sun and the moon   In the other direction there are cumulus clouds and the sky      In the other direction there is why   They look at what they see   They look very long while they talk along   And they may be said to see that at which they look      Whenever there is no chance of its not being warmer      Than if they wish which they were.   They see that they have what is there may there      Be there also what is to be there if they may care      They care for it of course they care for it.      Now only think three times roses green and blue      And vegetables and pumpkins and pansies too   Which they like as they are very likely not to be      Reminded that it is more than ever necessary   That they should never be surprised at any one time   At just what they have been given by taking what they have      Which they are very careful not to add with      As they may easily indulge in the fragrance      Not only of which but by which they know      That they tell them so.

It is remarkable how quickly they learn   But if they learn and it is very remarkable how quickly they learn   It makes not only but by and by      And they may not only be not here      But not there   Which after all makes no difference   After all this does not make any does not make any difference   I add added it to it.

"No one can pronounce your name.  I alone know the perfect inflection.  They lack the tenderness in which it flows  and the sweetness in the consonants.

Common words  that can be said simply  even without knowing you, without loving you."
"You didn ' t listen to the beating of a tree ' s heart,  couched against the trunk gazing upwards,  you didn ' t see the leaves moving  with the throb of a heart,  you didn ' t feel the shudder  of the swaying branches above your body,  you didn ' t listen to the heart of the pines  when the wind moves them and those leaves  that are like green fragrant pins  fall, and when the clouds pass,  you didn ' t see that the world was turning,  the entire world, and you didn ' t feel  that the sky was drawing near,  was entering inside the pines,  and that you were disappearing, penetrating with it  inside the pines, becoming in that sky another tree."

We never managed to agree  about man ' s true nature,  some fools think  perhaps in gratitude  for those who deified us  in other times  that man is a god,  but I and certain of my friends and enemies  think that he is edible.  The edible man  is always shy and trembling,  without claws and hair or with very little hair;  the man-god distributes food  with his hands, so I ' ve been told,  he has a whip in his tongue and in his eyes.  In olden days, when he took up his position in the arena,  or in the desert, he wore a halo  or carried a magic wand,  he had a long mane  like a lion ' s, which tangles in the teeth.  All this disturbs me:  sometimes I dream  of a rug whose coat  resembles mine, and I cry  stretched out on my own skin.  It ' s strange.  Inconceivable.  But there are stranger things:  Don't birds exist  who pass the time singing,  ridiculous doves, and an infinite series of fish  and beetles I ' m unaware of  but which bother me?  Isn't there a poet who thinks about me constantly,  who believes that in my skin are signs revealing  man ' s destiny drawn by God  in a poem?  "
"Dolphins don ' t play in the waves  as people think.  Dolphins fall asleep going down to the ocean floor.  What are they looking for?  I don ' t know.  When they touch the end of the water  abruptly they awake  and rise again because the sea is very deep  and when they rise, what are they looking for?  I don ' t know.  And they see the sky and it makes them sleepy again  and they go back down asleep,  and they touch the ocean floor again  and awaken and rise back up.  Our dreams are like that."
"It would be useless to cover mirrors  so that the people inside don ' t get out  who have lodged there  waiting for someone to be reflected  and ominously or piously, unnoticed,  they could leave the luminous  dwelling where they live,  to attack us or protect us or pervert us.  From its earliest beginnings that I recall  a heavenly and diabolical court has attended me:  when my nanny Celestina buttoned her housecoat  (it ' s true that she was dyeing her hair  and to surprise her I ventured beside her reflection)  four dragonflies fluttered about  announcing rain, one grazed my cheek and they came out  of the area where she was reflected;  they followed me always or followed her,  with her death they disappeared,  except on the eve of a storm.  When my mother got dressed to go to the ball  and fastened the band on her purple velvet belt  an angel departed with her when she put out the light  accompanied her to the car  and that ' s why I believe she returned that night  in which I trembled with fear for her death.  When the ballet teacher  curtsied within the ebony frame, three people with masks  came out singing and visited me in a dream.  When the doctor ascending in the elevator  fixed his tie  fifty faces with white aprons,  which I couldn ' t examine, furtively sprang out  from that small perfectly illuminated moon.  When Susana told me in the candy shop  my hair ' s a mess,  she looked at herself in the lid of the compact,  imprudently I said â€œLet me see,â€  I leaned into the shining circle:  a turbulent dialogue startled us,  three youths with necklaces,  thin, from having been cooped up in a tiny circle,  malicious,  sat down at our table.  Ever since that day they ' ve all interfered  in our telephone calls.  My dog, who attentively admired himself once,  barked insistently,  shrewder he had seen a certain corporality  leaving the mirror:  a soft white rabbit visited me one afternoon.  But I won ' t list the cats,  the horses, the gazelles, the tortoises,  the necrophiliacs,  the cannibals, the unborn,  the gnomes, the giants, the onanists,  that came out of the mirrors where imprudently  I glanced beside other people who didn ' t see them  blinded by their own image.  Now I no longer share a mirror with anyone  because if my reflection takes the opportunity  to let them free, armies of other people,  a world too numerous  will be taking shape though it be difficult to stop  because the mirror will say â€œgrow and multiplyâ€  to the point of dislodging the universe  secretly hoping for that  after having repeated it so long  in water, in obsidian,  in metals and in subsequent mirrors.  Nor must we think that the whole thing is horrible.  The homeless will take shelter  inside of mirrors  (they won ' t ever have lived in places so luminous)  they will come out in their turn  when those who were reflection  contemplate themselves forgetting their experience."
"Be careful with your imagination.  Someplace on earth it remains, all the time it follows us  little by little turning into crude or delicate reality  what man or beast, plants or stones imagined.  The sick with fever, those who shake, those who want to and cannot speak,  in waiting rooms, amid pages of newspapers, oranges,  those who gaze at the ceiling or else the sun, injured,  those who embrace unlawfully, not knowing why  or in the blue precinct of marriage, those disfigured by hearty laughter,  the children, the slaves, the unjust, those who go shopping, handle meat,  the prisoners, soldiers, tyrants, with faces of singers,  the swimmers, the eager executioners, those who blaspheme,  those who beg or give, the missionaries, the anarchists,  the submissive, the proud, the solitary, those who don ' t understand,  those who work constantly,  those who get tired after never doing anything  again don ' t do anything without a break, irreducibly, the unborn,  those who carry signs in their fur, letters, drawings,  mysteries that no one has deciphered,  those who wash everything all day long like the raccoon,    the foul-smelling that scavenge for bones or excrement,  wallowing about to stink even more,  those who simply appear spiritual, or musical, or poetic,  those who devour others like them  or themselves because driven mad,  those that are streaked, with spots, with silver scales and tails,  the ferocious and the domesticated, those who love,  those who eat each other in order to fecundate,  those who live only on grass or precious milk  or those who need to eat rotten meat  those who crawl or the most beautiful, with princely feathers  those whom the water gathers among its glass, clear green or black  in the dark molds of the earth, buried,    those who take so long in dying that they do not die  and seem like plants or else stones, with the additions of time  those who barely live by a miracle, by suicide, on nothing  everything that they have imagined  and that we mortals imagine  forms the reality of the world."
