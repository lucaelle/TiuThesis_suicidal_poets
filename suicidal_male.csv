"   The flower-fed buffaloes of the spring    In the days of long ago,      Ranged where the locomotives sing      And the prairie flowers lie low:—      The tossing, blooming, perfumed grass      Is swept away by the wheat,      Wheels and wheels and wheels spin by      In the spring that still is sweet.      But the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring      Left us, long ago.      They gore no more, they bellow no more,      They trundle around the hills no more:—      With the Blackfeet, lying low,      With the Pawnees, lying low,      Lying low.   "
"   No one kneads us again out of earth and clay,   no one incants our dust.   No one.   Blessèd art thou, No One.   In thy sight would   we bloom.   In thy   spite.   A Nothing   we were, are now, and ever   shall be, blooming:   the Nothing-, the   No-One's-Rose.   With   our pistil soul-bright,   our stamen heaven-waste,   our corona red   from the purpleword we sang   over, O over   the thorn.   "
"            (To a Man who maintained that the Mausoleum is the Stateliest Possible Manner of Interment)            I would be one with the dark, dark earth:—Follow the plough with a yokel tread.I would be part of the Indian corn,Walking the rows with the plumes o'erhead. I would be one with the lavish earth, Eating the bee-stung apples red: Walking where lambs walk on the hills;By oak-grove paths to the pools be led.I would be one with the dark-bright nightWhen sparkling skies and the lightning wed—Walking on with the vicious windBy roads whence even the dogs have fled.I would be one with the sacred earthOn to the end, till I sleep with the dead.Terror shall put no spears through me.Peace shall jewel my shroud instead.I shall be one with all pit-black thingsFinding their lowering threat unsaid:Stars for my pillow there in the gloom,—Oak-roots arching about my head!Stars, like daisies, shall rise through the earth,Acorns fall round my breast that bled.Children shall weave there a flowery chain,Squirrels on acorn-hearts be fed:—Fruit of the traveller-heart of me,Fruit of my harvest-songs long sped:Sweet with the life of my sunburned daysWhen the sheaves were ripe, and the apples red.   "
"   At home, in my flannel gown, like a bear to its floe,   I clambered to bed; up the globe's impossible sides   I sailed all night—till at last, with my black beard,   My furs and my dogs, I stood at the northern pole.   There in the childish night my companions lay frozen,   The stiff furs knocked at my starveling throat,   And I gave my great sigh: the flakes came huddling,   Were they really my end? In the darkness I turned to my rest.   —Here, the flag snaps in the glare and silence   Of the unbroken ice. I stand here,   The dogs bark, my beard is black, and I stare   At the North Pole . . .                                           And now what? Why, go back.   Turn as I please, my step is to the south.   The world—my world spins on this final point   Of cold and wretchedness: all lines, all winds   End in this whirlpool I at last discover.   And it is meaningless. In the child's bed   After the night's voyage, in that warm world   Where people work and suffer for the end   That crowns the pain—in that Cloud-Cuckoo-Land   I reached my North and it had meaning.   Here at the actual pole of my existence,   Where all that I have done is meaningless,   Where I die or live by accident alone—   Where, living or dying, I am still alone;   Here where North, the night, the berg of death   Crowd me out of the ignorant darkness,   I see at last that all the knowledge       I wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me—   Is worthless as ignorance: nothing comes from nothing,   The darkness from the darkness. Pain comes from the darkness    And we call it wisdom. It is pain.   "
"   We make our meek adjustments,   Contented with such random consolations   As the wind deposits   In slithered and too ample pockets.   For we can still love the world, who find   A famished kitten on the step, and know   Recesses for it from the fury of the street,   Or warm torn elbow coverts.   We will sidestep, and to the final smirk   Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb   That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,   Facing the dull squint with what innocence   And what surprise!   And yet these fine collapses are not lies   More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;   Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.   We can evade you, and all else but the heart:   What blame to us if the heart live on.   The game enforces smirks; but we have seen   The moon in lonely alleys make   A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,   And through all sound of gaiety and quest   Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.   "
"   How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest   The seagull’s wings shall dip and pivot him,   Shedding white rings of tumult, building high   Over the chained bay waters Liberty—   Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes      As apparitional as sails that cross   Some page of figures to be filed away;   —Till elevators drop us from our day ...   I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights   With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene   Never disclosed, but hastened to again,   Foretold to other eyes on the same screen;   And Thee, across the harbor, silver paced   As though the sun took step of thee yet left   Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,—   Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!   Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft   A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,   Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,   A jest falls from the speechless caravan.   Down Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,   A rip-tooth of the sky’s acetylene;   All afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn ...   Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.   And obscure as that heaven of the Jews,   Thy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow   Of anonymity time cannot raise:   Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.   O harp and altar, of the fury fused,   (How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)   Terrific threshold of the prophet’s pledge,   Prayer of pariah, and the lover’s cry,   Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift   Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,   Beading thy path—condense eternity:   And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.   Under thy shadow by the piers I waited   Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.   The City’s fiery parcels all undone,   Already snow submerges an iron year ...   O Sleepless as the river under thee,   Vaulting the sea, the prairies’ dreaming sod,            Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend   And of the curveship lend a myth to God."
"   Once I loved a spider When I was born a fly, A velvet-footed spider With a gown of rainbow-dye. She ate my wings and gloated. She bound me with a hair. She drove me to her parlor Above her winding stair. To educate young spiders She took me all apart. My ghost came back to haunt her. I saw her eat my heart.    "
"            (In Springfield, Illinois)            It is portentous, and a thing of state   That here at midnight, in our little town   A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,   Near the old court-house pacing up and down.   Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards   He lingers where his children used to play,   Or through the market, on the well-worn stones   He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.   A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black,   A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl   Make him the quaint great figure that men love,   The prairie-lawyer, master of us all.   He cannot sleep upon his hillside now.   He is among us:—as in times before!   And we who toss and lie awake for long   Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.   His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings.   Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?   Too many peasants fight, they know not why,   Too many homesteads in black terror weep.   The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.   He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.   He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now   The bitterness, the folly and the pain.   He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn   Shall come;—the shining hope of Europe free;   The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,   Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea.   It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,   That all his hours of travail here for men   Seem yet in vain.   And who will bring white peace   That he may sleep upon his hill again?   "
"   Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.      After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,      we ourselves flash and yearn,   and moreover my mother told me as a boy      (repeatingly) ‘Ever to confess you’re bored      means you have no   Inner Resources.’ I conclude now I have no      inner resources, because I am heavy bored.   Peoples bore me,   literature bores me, especially great literature,      Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes      as bad as achilles,   who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.      And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag      and somehow a dog   has taken itself & its tail considerably away   into mountains or sea or sky, leaving               behind: me, wag.   "
"   There sat down, once, a thing on Henry’s heart      só heavy, if he had a hundred years   & more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time      Henry could not make good.   Starts again always in Henry’s ears   the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.   And there is another thing he has in mind      like a grave Sienese face a thousand years   would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,      with open eyes, he attends, blind.   All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;      thinking.   But never did Henry, as he thought he did,   end anyone and hacks her body up   and hide the pieces, where they may be found.   He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody’s missing.      Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.   Nobody is ever missing.   "
"   [1]   The Governor your husband lived so long      moved you not, restless, waiting for him? Still,      you were a patient woman.—   I seem to see you pause here still:   Sylvester, Quarles, in moments odd you pored      before a fire at, bright eyes on the Lord,      all the children still.   ‘Simon ...’ Simon will listen while you read a Song.       [2]   Outside the New World winters in grand dark      white air lashing high thro’ the virgin stands   foxes down foxholes sigh,   surely the English heart quails, stunned.   I doubt if Simon than this blast, that sea,   spares from his rigour for your poetry   more. We are on each other’s hands   who care. Both of our worlds unhanded us. Lie stark,       [3]   thy eyes look to me mild. Out of maize & air      your body’s made, and moves. I summon, see,   from the centuries it.   I think you won’t stay. How do we      linger, diminished, in our lovers’ air,      implausibly visible, to whom, a year,      years, over interims; or not;   to a long stranger; or not; shimmer & disappear.       [4]   Jaw-ript, rot with its wisdom, rending then;   then not. When the mouth dies, who misses you?   Your master never died,   Simon ah thirty years past you—   Pockmarkt & westward staring on a haggard deck   it seems I find you, young. I come to check,   I come to stay with you,   and the Governor, & Father, & Simon, & the huddled men.       [5]   By the week we landed we were, most, used up.      Strange ships across us, after a fortnight’s winds      unfavouring, frightened us;   bone-sad cold, sleet, scurvy; so were ill   many as one day we could have no sermons;   broils, quelled; a fatherless child unkennelled; vermin      crowding & waiting: waiting.   And the day itself he leapt ashore young Henry Winthrop       [6]   (delivered from the waves; because he found   off their wigwams, sharp-eyed, a lone canoe   across a tidal river,   that water glittered fair & blue   & narrow, none of the other men could swim      and the plantation’s prime theft up to him,   shouldered on a glad day   hard on the glorious feasting of thanksgiving) drowned.       [7]   How long with nothing in the ruinous heat,      clams & acorns stomaching, distinction perishing,      at which my heart rose,   with brackish water, we would sing.   When whispers knew the Governor’s last bread      was browning in his oven, we were discourag’d.      The Lady Arbella dying—   dyings—at which my heart    rose, but I did submit.       [8]   That beyond the Atlantic wound our woes enlarge      is hard, hard that starvation burnishes our fear,      but I do gloss for You.   Strangers & pilgrims fare we here,   declaring we seek a City. Shall we be deceived?   I know whom I have trusted, & whom I have believed,      and that he is able to   keep    that I have committed to his charge.       [9]   Winter than summer worse, that first, like a file      on a quick, or the poison suck of a thrilled tooth;      and still we may unpack.   Wolves & storms among, uncouth   board-pieces, boxes, barrels vanish, grow   houses, rise. Motes that hop in sunlight slow      indoors, and I am Ruth   away: open my mouth, my eyes wet: I wóuld smile:       [10]   vellum I palm, and dream. Their forest dies   to greensward, privets, elms & towers, whence      a nightingale is throbbing.   Women sleep sound. I was happy once . .      (Something keeps on not happening; I shrink?)      These minutes all their passions & powers sink      and I am not one chance   for an unknown cry or a flicker of unknown eyes.       [11]   Chapped souls ours, by the day Spring’s strong winds swelled,      Jack’s pulpits arched, more glad. The shawl I pinned      flaps like a shooting soul   might in such weather Heaven send.   Succumbing half, in spirit, to a salmon sash   I prod the nerveless novel succotash—   I must be disciplined,   in arms, against that one, and our dissidents, and myself.       [12]   Versing, I shroud among the dynasties;   quaternion on quaternion, tireless I phrase   anything past, dead, far,   sacred, for a barbarous place.   —To please your wintry father? all this bald   abstract didactic rime I read appalled   harassed for your fame   mistress neither of fiery nor velvet verse, on your knees       [13]   hopeful & shamefast, chaste, laborious, odd,   whom the sea tore. —The damned roar with loss,      so they hug & are mean   with themselves, and I cannot be thus.   Why then do I repine, sick, bad, to long   after what must not be? I lie wrong   once more. For at fourteen   I found my heart more carnal and sitting loose from God,       [14]   vanity & the follies of youth took hold of me;      then the pox blasted, when the Lord returned.      That year for my sorry face   so-much-older Simon burned,   so Father smiled, with love. Their will be done.      He to me ill lingeringly, learning to shun   a bliss, a lightning blood   vouchsafed, what did seem life. I kissed his Mystery.       [15]   Drydust in God’s eye the aquavivid skin      of Simon snoring lit with fountaining dawn      when my eyes unlid, sad.   John Cotton shines on Boston’s sin—      I ám drawn, in pieties that seem   the weary drizzle of an unremembered dream.      Women have gone mad      at twenty-one. Ambition mines, atrocious, in.       [16]   Food endless, people few, all to be done.   As pippins roast, the question of the wolves   turns & turns.   Fangs of a wolf will keep, the neck   round of a child, that child brave. I remember who      in meeting smiled & was punisht, and I know who      whispered & was stockt.   We lead a thoughtful life. But Boston’s cage we shun.       [17]   The winters close, Springs open, no child stirs      under my withering heart, O seasoned heart   God grudged his aid.   All things else soil like a shirt.   Simon is much away. My executive stales.   The town came through for the cartway by the pales,      but my patience is short.   I revolt from, I am like, these savage foresters       [18]   whose passionless dicker in the shade, whose glance      impassive & scant, belie their murderous cries   when quarry seems to show.   Again I must have been wrong, twice.   Unwell in a new way. Can that begin?   God brandishes. O love, O I love. Kin,   gather. My world is strange   and merciful, ingrown months, blessing a swelling trance.       [19]   So squeezed, wince you I scream? I love you & hate      off with you. Ages! Useless. Below my waist      he has me in Hell’s vise.   Stalling. He let go. Come back: brace   me somewhere. No. No. Yes! everything down      hardens I press with horrible joy down      my back cracks like a wrist   shame I am voiding oh behind it is too late       [20]   hide me forever I work thrust I must free   now I all muscles & bones concentrate   what is living from dying?   Simon I must leave you so untidy   Monster you are killing me Be sure   I’ll have you later Women do endure   I can can no longer   and it passes the wretched trap whelming and I am me       [21]   drencht & powerful, I did it with my body!      One proud tug greens heaven. Marvellous,      unforbidding Majesty.   Swell, imperious bells. I fly.   Mountainous, woman not breaks and will bend:      sways God nearby: anguish comes to an end.      Blossomed Sarah, and I   blossom. Is that thing alive? I hear a famisht howl.       [22]   Beloved household, I am Simon’s wife,   and the mother of Samuel—whom greedy yet I miss      out of his kicking place.   More in some ways I feel at a loss,   freer. Cantabanks & mummers, nears   longing for you. Our chopping scores my ears,      our costume bores my eyes.   St. George to the good sword, rise! chop-logic’s rife       [23]   & fever & Satan & Satan’s ancient fere.   Pioneering is not feeling well,   not Indians, beasts.   Not all their riddling can forestall   one leaving. Sam, your uncle has had to   go fróm us to live with God. ‘Then Aunt went too?’   Dear, she does wait still.   Stricken: ‘Oh. Then he takes    us one by one.’ My dear.       [24]   Forswearing it otherwise, they starch their minds.      Folkmoots, & blether, blether. John Cotton rakes      to the synod of Cambridge.   Down from my body my legs flow,   out from it arms wave, on it my head shakes.      Now Mistress Hutchinson rings forth a call—   should she? many creep out at a broken wall—   affirming the Holy Ghost   dwells in one justified. Factioning passion blinds       [25]   all to her good, all    can she be exiled?   Bitter sister, victim! I miss you.   —I miss you, Anne,   day or night weak as a child,   tender & empty, doomed, quick to no tryst.      —I hear you. Be kind, you who leaguer   my image in the mist.   —Be kind you, to one unchained eager far & wild       [26]   and if, 0 my love, my heart is breaking, please      neglect my cries and I will spare you. Deep      in Time’s grave, Love’s, you lie still.   Lie still. —Now? That happy shape   my forehead had under my most long, rare,      ravendark, hidden, soft bodiless hair   you award me still.   You must not love me, but    I do not bid you cease.       [27]   Veiled my eyes, attending. How can it be I?      Moist, with parted lips, I listen, wicked.      I shake in the morning & retch.   Brood I do on myself naked.   A fading world I dust, with fingers new.   —I have earned the right to be alone with you.      —What right can that be?   Convulsing, if you love, enough, like a sweet lie.       [28]   Not that, I know, you can. This cratered skin,   like the crabs & shells of my Palissy ewer, touch!      Oh, you do, you do?   Falls on me what I like a witch,   for lawless holds, annihilations of law   which Time and he and man abhor, foresaw:   sharper than what my Friend   brought me for my revolt when I moved smooth & thin,       [29]   faintings black, rigour, chilling, brown   parching, back, brain burning, the grey pocks      itch, a manic stench   of pustules snapping, pain floods the palm,   sleepless, or a red shaft with a dreadful start      rides at the chapel, like a slipping heart.   My soul strains in one qualm   ah but this is not to save me but to throw me down.       [30]   And out of this I lull. It lessens. Kiss me.      That once. As sings out up in sparkling dark      a trail of a star & dies,   while the breath flutters, sounding, mark,      so shorn ought such caresses to us be      who, deserving nothing, flush and flee      the darkness of that light,   a lurching frozen from a warm dream. Talk to me.       [31]   —It is Spring’s New England. Pussy willows wedge      up in the wet. Milky crestings, fringed   yellow, in heaven, eyed   by the melting hand-in-hand or mere   desirers single, heavy-footed, rapt,   make surge poor human hearts. Venus is trapt—   the hefty pike shifts, sheer—   in Orion blazing. Warblings, odours, nudge to an edge—       [32]   —Ravishing, ha, what crouches outside ought,      flamboyant, ill, angelic. Often, now,      I am afraid of you.   I am a sobersides; I know.   I want to take you for my lover. —Do.      —I hear a madness. Harmless I to you      am not, not I? —No.   —I cannot but be. Sing a concord of our thought.       [33]   —Wan dolls in indigo on gold: refrain   my western lust. I am drowning in this past.      I lose sight of you   who mistress me from air. Unbraced   in delirium of the grand depths, giving away      haunters what kept me, I breathe solid spray.      —I am losing you!   Straiten me on. —I suffered living like a stain:       [34]   I trundle the bodies, on the iron bars,      over that fire backward & forth; they burn;   bits fall. I wonder ifI killed them. Women serve my turn.   —Dreams! You are good. —No. —Dense with hardihood      the wicked are dislodged, and lodged the good.   In green space we are safe.   God awaits us (but I    am yielding) who Hell wars.       [35]   —I cannot feel myself God waits. He flies   nearer a kindly world; or he is flown.   One Saturday’s rescue   won’t show. Man is entirely alone   may be. I am a man of griefs & fits   trying to be my friend. And the brown smock splits,      down the pale flesh a gash   broadens and Time holds up your heart against my eyes.       [36]   —Hard and divided heaven! creases me. Shame      is failing. My breath is scented, and I throw      hostile glances towards God.   Crumpling plunge of a pestle, bray:   sin cross & opposite, wherein I survive      nightmares of Eden. Reaches foul & live      he for me, this soul   to crunch, a minute tangle of eternal flame.       [37]   I fear Hell’s hammer-wind. But fear does wane.      Death’s blossoms grain my hair; I cannot live.   A black joy clashes   joy, in twilight. The Devil said   ‘I will deal toward her softly, and her enchanting cries      will fool the horns of Adam.’ Father of lies,   a male great pestle smashes   small women swarming towards the mortar’s rim in vain.       [38]   I see the cruel spread Wings black with saints!      Silky my breasts not his, mine, mine, to withhold      or tender, tender.   I am sifting, nervous, and bold.   The light is changing. Surrender this loveliness      you cannot make me do. But I will. Yes.      What horror, down stormy air,   warps towards me? My threatening promise faints—       [39]   torture me, Father, lest not I be thine!      Tribunal terrible & pure, my God,   mercy for him and me.   Faces half-fanged, Christ drives abroad,   and though the crop hopes, Jane is so slipshod      I cry. Evil dissolves, & love, like foam;   that love. Prattle of children powers me home,      my heart claps like the swan’s   under a frenzy of who love me & who shine.       [40]   As a canoe slides by on one strong stroke      hope his hélp not I, who do hardly bear      his gift still. But whisper   I am not utterly. I pare   an apple for my pipsqueak Mercy and      she runs & all need naked apples, fanned      their tinier envies.   Vomitings, trots, rashes. Can be hope a cloak?       [41]   for the man with cropt ears glares. My fingers tighten      my skirt. I pass. Alas! I pity all.   Shy, shy, with mé, Dorothy.   Moonrise, and frightening hoots. ‘Mother,   how long will I be dead?’ Our friend the owl      vanishes, darling, but your homing soul   retires on Heaven, Mercy:   not we one instant die, only our dark does lighten.       [42]   When by me in the dusk my child sits down      I am myself. Simon, if it’s that loose,   let me wiggle it out.   You’ll get a bigger one there, & bite.   How they loft, how their sizes delight and grate.      The proportioned, spiritless poems accumulate.      And they publish them   away in brutish London, for a hollow crown.       [43]   Father is not himself. He keeps his bed,   and threw a saffron scum Thursday. God-forsaken words   escaped him raving. Save,   Lord, thy servant zealous & just.   Sam he saw back from Harvard. He did scold      his secting enemies. His stomach is cold   while we drip, while   my baby John breaks out. O far from where he bred!       [44]   Bone of moaning: sung Where he has gone   a thousand summers by truth-hallowed souls;      be still. Agh, he is gone!   Where? I know. Beyond the shoal.   Still-all a Christian daughter grinds her teeth      a little. This our land has ghosted with      our dead: I am at home.   Finish, Lord, in me this work thou hast begun.       [45]   And they tower, whom the pear-tree lured   to let them fall, fierce mornings they reclined      down the brook-bank to the east   fishing for shiners with a crookt pin,   wading, dams massing, well, and Sam’s to be      a doctor in Boston. After the divisive sea,      and death’s first feast,   and the galled effort on the wilderness endured,       [46]   Arminians, and the King bore against us;   of an ‘inward light’ we hear with horror.   Whose fan is in his hand   and he will thoroughly purge his floor,   come towards me. I have what licks the joints      and bites the heart, which winter more appoints.      Iller I, oftener.   Hard at the outset; in the ending thus hard, thus?       [47]   Sacred & unutterable Mind   flashing thorough the universe one thought,   I do wait without peace.   In the article of death I budge.   Eat my sore breath, Black Angel. Let me die.   Body a-drain, when will you be dry   and countenance my speed   to Heaven’s springs? lest stricter writhings have me declined.       [48]   ‘What are those pictures in the air at night,      Mother?’ Mercy did ask. Space charged with faces      day & night! I place   a goatskin’s fetor, and sweat: fold me   in savoury arms. Something is shaking, wrong.      He smells the musket and lifts it. It is long.      It points at my heart.   Missed he must have. In the gross storm of sunlight       [49]   I sniff a fire burning without outlet,   consuming acrid its own smoke. It’s me.   Ruined laughter sounds   outside. Ah but I waken, free.   And so I am about again. I hagged   a fury at the short maid, whom tongues tagged,      and I am sorry. Once   less I was anxious when more passioned to upset       [50]   the mansion & the garden & the beauty of God.      Insectile unreflective busyness   blunts & does amend.   Hangnails, piles, fibs, life’s also.   But we are that from which draws back a thumb.      The seasons stream and, somehow, I am become      an old woman. It’s so:   I look. I bear to look. Strokes once more his rod.       [51]   My window gives on the graves, in our great new house      (how many burned?) upstairs, among the elms.      I lie, & endure, & wonder.   A haze slips sometimes over my dreams      and holiness on horses’ bells shall stand.      Wandering pacemaker, unsteadying friend,      in a redskin calm I wait:   beat when you will our end. Sinkings & droopings drowse.       [52]   They say thro’ the fading winter Dorothy fails,   my second, who than I bore one more, nine;   and I see her inearthed. I linger.   Seaborn she wed knelt before Simon;   Simon I, and linger. Black-yellow seething, vast   it lies fróm me, mine: all they look aghast.   It will be a glorious arm.   Docile I watch. My wreckt chest hurts when Simon pales.       [53]   In the yellowing days your faces wholly fail,      at Fall’s onset. Solemn voices fade.   I feel no coverlet.   Light notes leap, a beckon, swaying   the tilted, sickening ear within. I’ll—I’ll—   I am closed & coming. Somewhere! I defile      wide as a cloud, in a cloud,   unfit, desirous, glad—even the singings veil—       [54]   —You are not ready? You áre ready. Pass,   as shadow gathers shadow in the welling night.      Fireflies of childhood torch   you down. We commit our sister down.   One candle mourn by, which a lover gave,   the use’s edge and order of her grave.   Quiet? Moisture shoots.   Hungry throngs collect. They sword into the carcass.       [55]   Headstones stagger under great draughts of time      after heads pass out, and their world must reel      speechless, blind in the end   about its chilling star: thrift tuft,   whin cushion—nothing. Already with the wounded flying      dark air fills, I am a closet of secrets dying,      races murder, foxholes hold men,   reactor piles wage slow upon the wet brain rime.       [56]   I must pretend to leave you. Only you draw off      a benevolent phantom. I say you seem to me   drowned towns off England,   featureless as those myriads   who what bequeathed save fire-ash, fossils, burled      in the open river-drifts of the Old World?   Simon lived on for years.   I renounce not even ragged glances, small teeth, nothing,       [57]   O all your ages at the mercy of my loves   together lie at once, forever or   so long as I happen.   In the rain of pain & departure, still   Love has no body and presides the sun,   and elf’s from silence melody. I run.   Hover, utter, still,   a sourcing    whom my lost candle like the firefly loves.   "
"   If, in an odd angle of the hutment,   A puppy laps the water from a can   Of flowers, and the drunk sergeant shaving      Whistles O Paradiso!—shall I say that man      Is not as men have said: a wolf to man?   The other murderers troop in yawning;      Three of them play Pitch, one sleeps, and one      Lies counting missions, lies there sweating      Till even his heart beats: One; One; One.O murderers! ... Still, this is how it’s done:   This is a war.... But since these play, before they die,      Like puppies with their puppy; since, a man,   I did as these have done, but did not die—   I will content the people as I can   And give up these to them: Behold the man!   I have suffered, in a dream, because of him,      Many things; for this last saviour, man,   I have lied as I lie now. But what is lying?   Men wash their hands, in blood, as best they can:      I find no fault in this just man.   "
"   Take, oh, take those lips away That so sweetly were forsworn And those eyes, like break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn; But my kisses bring again, Seals of love, though sealed in vain. Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow, Which thy frozen bosom bears, On whose tops the pinks that grow Are of those that April wears; But first set my poor heart free, Bound in those icy chains by thee.

Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone.   Time has its way with you there, and the clay has its own.   “We have buried him now,” thought your foes, and in secret rejoiced.   They made a brave show of their mourning, their hatred unvoiced.   They had snarled at you, barked at you, foamed at you day after day,   Now you were ended. They praised you . . . and laid you away.   The others that mourned you in silence and terror and truth,   The widow bereft of her crust, and the boy without youth,   The mocked and the scorned and the wounded, the lame and the poor,   That should have remembered forever . . . remember no more.   Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call,   The lost, that in armies wept over your funeral pall?   They call on the names of a hundred high-valiant ones,   A hundred white eagles have risen the sons of your sons,   The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began   The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man.   Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone,   Time has its way with you there and the clay has its own.   Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man that kindled the flame—   To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name,   To live in mankind, far, far more . . . than to live in a name.   "

"   Deola passes her mornings sitting in a cafe,   and nobody looks at her. Everyone’s rushing to work,   under a sun still fresh with the dawn. Even Deola   isn’t looking for anyone: she smokes serenely, breathing   the morning. In years past, she slept at this hour   to recover her strength: the throw on her bed   was black with the boot-prints of soldiers and workers,   the backbreaking clients. But now, on her own,   it’s different: the work’s more refined, and it’s easier.   Like the gentleman yesterday, who woke her up early,   kissed her, and took her (I’d stay awhile, dear,   in Turin with you, if I could"
"   The drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch.   From the tavern, five minutes through the dark field   and you’re home. But first, there’s the cool grass   to enjoy, and the mechanic will sleep here till dawn.   A few feet away, the red and black sign that rises   from the field: if you’re too close, you can’t read it,   it’s that big. At this hour, it’s still wet dew.   Later, the streets will cover it with dust, as it covers   the bushes. The mechanic, beneath it, stretches in sleep.   Silence is total. Shortly, in the warmth of the sun,   one car after another will pass, waking the dust.   At the top of the hill they slow down for the curve,   then plunge down the slope. A few of the cars   stop at the garage, in the dust, to drink a few liters.   At this time of the morning, the mechanics, still dazed,   will be sitting on oil drums, waiting for work.   It’s a pleasure to spend the morning sitting in the shade,   where the stink of oil’s cut with the smell of green,   of tobacco, of wine, and where work comes to them,   right to the door. Sometimes it’s even amusing:   peasants’ wives come to scold them, blaming the garage   for the traffic—it frightens the animals and women—   and for making their husbands look sullen: quick trips   down the hill into Turin that lighten their wallets.   Between laughing and selling gas, one of them will pause:   these fields, it’s plain to see, are covered with road dust,   if you try to sit on the grass, it’ll drive you away.   On the hillside, there’s a vineyard he prefers to all others,   and in the end he’ll marry that vineyard and the sweet girl   who comes with it, and he’ll go out in the sun to work,   but now with a hoe, and his neck will turn brown,   and he’ll drink wine pressed on fall evenings from his own grapes.   Cars pass during the night, too, but more quietly,   so quiet the drunk in the ditch hasn’t woken. At night   they don’t raise much dust, and the beams of their headlights,   as they round the curve, reveal in full the sign in the field.   Near dawn, they glide cautiously along, you can’t hear a thing   except maybe the breeze, and from the top of the hill   they disappear into the plain, sinking in shadows.   "
"   Dawn on the black hill, and up on the roof   cats drowsing. Last night, there was a boy   who fell off this roof, breaking his back.   The wind riffles the cool leaves of the trees.   The red clouds above are warm and move slowly.   A stray dog appears in the alley below, sniffing   the boy on the cobblestones, and a raw wail   rises up among chimneys: someone’s unhappy.   The crickets were singing all night, and the stars   were blown out by the wind. In dawn’s glow,   even the eyes of the cats in love were extinguished,   the cats the boy watched. The female is crying,   no toms are around and nothing can soothe her:   not the tops of the trees, not the red clouds.   She cries to the wide sky, as if it were still night.   The boy was spying on cats making love.   The stray dog sniffs the boy’s body and growls;   he got here at dawn, fleeing the glow   that crept down the far hill. Swimming the river   that drenched him as dew drenches fields,   he was finally caught by the light. The bitches   were still howling.                              The river runs smoothly,   skimmed by birds that drop from red clouds,   elated to find their river deserted.   "
"   The big front wall that blocks off the courtyard   often catches the newborn light of the sun   like the side of a barn. The body awakes   in the morning to a room, messy and empty,   that smells of the first, clumsy perfume.   Even that body, wrapped now in sheets,   is the same that it was when it thrilled in discovery.   Her body wakes alone to the extended call   of morning, the languor of another morning   returning in the heavy shadows: the barn   of childhood and the heavy tiredness of sun   hot in the indolent doorways. A perfume   worked itself into the usual sweat   of her hair, a smell the animals knew.   Her body took secret pleasure in the sun’s   suggestive, serene caress—like a real touch.   The languor of bed saps the sprawled limbs,   still youthful and plump, like a child’s.   The clumsy child used to smell the mixed scent   of tobacco and hay, used to tremble when touched   by the man’s quick hands: she liked playing games.   Sometimes she played lying down with the man   in the hay, but he wasn’t smelling her hair:   he’d find her closed legs in the hay and pry   them open, then crush her like he was her father.   The perfume was flowers ground upon stones.   It often returns, in the slow rise from sleep,   that undone aroma of far-off flowers,   of barns and of sun. No man can know   the subtle caress of that sour memory.   No man can see, beyond that sprawled body,   that childhood passed in such clumsy anxiety.   "
"   We would go down to the fish market early   to cleanse our vision: the fish were silver,   and scarlet, and green, and the color of sea.   The fish were lovelier than even the sea   with its silvery scales. We thought of return.   Lovely too the women with jars on their heads,   olive-brown clay, shaped softly like thighs:   we each thought of our women, their voices,   their laughs, the way they walked down the street.   And each of us laughed. And it rained on the sea.   In vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth,   water softens the leaves and the grape-stems. The sky   is colored by occasional clouds that redden   with pleasure and sun. On earth, flavors and smells;   in the sky, color. And we were alone there.   We thought of return the way a man thinks   of morning after an utterly sleepless night.   We took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten   of fruit, all so alive in the musk of the sea.   We were drunk on the thought of impending return.   "
"   And then we cowards   who loved the whispering   evening, the houses,   the paths by the river,   the dirty red lights   of those places, the sweet   soundless sorrow—   we reached our hands out   toward the living chain   in silence, but our heart   startled us with blood,   and no more sweetness then,   no more losing ourselves   on the path by the river—   no longer slaves, we knew   we were alone and alive.   "
"   He’s brought me to hear his band. He sits in a corner   mouthing his clarinet. A hellish racket begins.   Outside, through flashes of lightning, wind gusts   and rain whips, knocking the lights out   every five minutes. In the dark, their faces   give it their all, contorted, as they play a dance tune   from memory. Full of energy, my poor friend   anchors them all from behind. His clarinet writhes,   breaks through the din, passes beyond it, releasing   like a lone soul, into a dry, rough silence.   The poor pieces of brass have been dented too often:   the hands working the stops also work in the fields,   and the obstinate brows stay fixed on the ground.   Miserable worn-out blood, weakened   by too many labors—you can hear it groan   in their notes, as my friend struggles to lead them,   his own hands hardened from swinging a hammer,   from pushing a plane, from scraping a living.   He’s lost all his old comrades, and he’s only thirty.   Part of the postwar group that grew up on hunger.   They all came to Turin, to look for a life,   and discovered injustice. He learned, without smiling,   how to work in a factory. He learned how to measure   the hunger of others with his own fatigue—   injustice was everywhere. He tried to find peace   by walking, at night, down streets without ends,   half-asleep, but found only thousands of streetlamps   blazing down on iniquity: hoarse women and drunks,   staggering puppets, far from their homes, He came,   one winter, to Turin—factory lights, smoke and ash—   and he learned what work is. He accepted that work   was part of a man’s hard fate; if all men did that,   there just might be some justice in this world.   And he found new comrades. He suffered their long words,   he listened and waited for them to be over.   He made them his comrades. Families of them   in each house, the city surrounded by them, the face   of the world covered with them. And each of them   felt desperate enough to conquer the world.   They sound harsh tonight, despite all the time   he spent coaching each player. He ignores the loud rain   and the flickering lights. His face is severe,   fixed on some grief, almost biting the mouthpiece.   I’ve seen this expression before, one evening, just us   and his brother, who’s ten years sadder than him.   We were up late in the dim light, the brother studying   a lathe he had built that didn’t work right,   and my poor friend cursing the fate that kept him there,   bound to his hammer and plane, feeding a pair   of old people he never asked for.                                                   That’s when he yelled   that it wasn’t fate that made the world suffer   or made the daylight spark blasphemous outbursts:   man is the guilty one. If we only could just leave,   and be hungry and free, and say no   to a life that uses our love and our piety,   our families, our patches of dirt, to shackle our hands."
"   It’s a fine fact that whenever I sit in a tavern corner   sipping a grappa, the pederast’s there, or the kids   with their screaming, or the unemployed guy,   or some beautiful girl outside—all breaking   the thread of my smoke. That’s how it is, kid,   I’m telling it straight, I work at Lucento."
"   The hard thing’s to sit without being noticed.   Everything else will come easy. Three sips   and the impulse returns to sit thinking alone.   Against the buzzing backdrop of noise   everything fades, and it’s suddenly a miracle   to be born and to stare at the glass. And work   (a man who’s alone can’t not think of work)   becomes again the old fate that suffering’s good   for focusing thought. And soon the eyes fix   on nothing particular, grieved, as if blind.   If this man gets up and goes home to sleep,   he’ll look like a blind man that’s lost. Anyone   could jump out of nowhere to brutally beat him.   A woman—beautiful, young—might appear,   and lie under a man in the street, and moan,   the way a woman once moaned under him.   But this man doesn’t see. He heads home to sleep   and life becomes nothing but the buzzing of silence.   Undressing this man you’d find a body that’s wasted   and, here and there, patches of fur. Who’d think,   to look at this man, that life once burned   in his lukewarm veins? No one would guess   that there was a woman, once, who gently touched   that body, who kissed that body, which shakes,   and wet it with tears, now that the man,   having come home to sleep, can’t sleep, only moan.   "
"   Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all, That which is gendered in the wilderness From lonely prairies and God’s tenderness. Imperial soul, star of a weedy stream, Born where the ghosts of buffaloes still dream, Whose spirit hoof-beats storm above his grave, Above that breast of earth and prairie-fire— Fire that freed the slave.

"   I. THEIR BASIC SAVAGERY Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, Pounded on the table, Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom, Hard as they were able, Boom, boom, BOOM, With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM. THEN I had religion, THEN I had a vision. I could not turn from their revel in derision. THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. Then along that riverbank A thousand miles Tattooed cannibals danced in files; Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong. And “BLOOD” screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors, “BLOOD” screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors, “Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle, Harry the uplands, Steal all the cattle, Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, Bing. Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM,” A roaring, epic, rag-time tune From the mouth of the Congo To the Mountains of the Moon. Death is an Elephant, Torch-eyed and horrible, Foam-flanked and terrible. BOOM, steal the pygmies, BOOM, kill the Arabs, BOOM, kill the white men, HOO, HOO, HOO. Listen to the yell of Leopold’s ghost Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host. Hear how the demons chuckle and yell Cutting his hands off, down in Hell. Listen to the creepy proclamation, Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation, Blown past the white-ants’ hill of clay, Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play: — “Be careful what you do, Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, And all of the other Gods of the Congo, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.”   "
"   I met a man in South Street, tall—   a nervous shark tooth swung on his chain.      His eyes pressed through green glass      —green glasses, or bar lights made them      so—         shine—                   GREEN—                              eyes—   stepped out—forgot to look at you   or left you several blocks away—   in the nickel-in-the-slot piano jogged   “Stamboul Nights”—weaving somebody’s nickel—sang—         O Stamboul Rose—dreams weave the rose!

"   It sat between my husband and my children.      A place was set for it—a plate of greens.      It had been there: I had seen it   But not somehow—but this was like a dream—   Not seen it so that I knew I saw it.   It was as if I could not know I saw it   Because I had never once in all my life   Not seen it. It was an eland.   An eland! That is why the children   Would ask my husband, for a joke, at Christmas:      “Father, is it Donner?” He would say, “No, Blitzen.”      It had been there always. Now we put silver      At its place at meals, fed it the same food      We ourselves ate, and said nothing. Many times      When it breathed heavily (when it had tried      A long useless time to speak) and reached to me      So that I touched it—of a different size      And order of being, like the live hard side      Of a horse’s neck when you pat the horse—   And looked with its great melting tearless eyes      Fringed with a few coarse wire-like lashes      Into my eyes, and whispered to me   So that my eyes turned backward in their sockets      And they said nothing—                                    many times      I have known, when they said nothing,      That it did not exist. If they had heard   They could not have been silent. And yet they heard;      Heard many times what I have spoken   When it could no longer speak, but only breathe—   When I could no longer speak, but only breathe.      And, after some years, the others came   And took it from me—it was ill, they told me—   And cured it, they wrote me: my whole city   Sent me cards lilac-branches, mourning   As I had mourned—                            and I was standing   By a grave in flowers, by dyed rolls of turf,   And a canvas marquee the last brown of earth.      It is over.            It is over so long that I begin to think   That it did not exist, that I have never—   And my son says, one morning, from the paper:   “An eland. Look, an eland!”                                              —It was so.   Today, in a German dictionary, I saw elend    And the heart in my breast turned over, it was—   It was a word one translates wretched.   It is as if someone remembered saying:   “This is an antimacassar that I grew from seed,”   And this were true.                                         And, truly,   One could not wish for anything more strange—   For anything more. And yet it wasn’t interesting .  .  .   —It was worse than impossible, it was a joke.   And yet when it was, I was—   Even to think that I once thought   That I could see it to feel the sweat   Like needles at my hair-roots, I am blind   —It was not even a joke, not even a joke.   Yet how can I believe it? Or believe that I   Owned it, a husband, children? Is my voice the voice   Of that skin of being—of what owns, is owned   In honor or dishonor, that is borne and bears—   Or of that raw thing, the being inside it      That has neither a wife, a husband, nor a child   But goes at last as naked from this world      As it was born into it—   And the eland comes and grazes on its grave.                                                           This is senseless?   Shall I make sense or shall I tell the truth?   Choose either—I cannot do both.   I tell myself that. And yet it is not so,      And what I say afterwards will not be so:      To be at all is to be wrong.                                                    Being is being old   And saying, almost comfortably, across a table      From—                from what I don’t know—                                                              in a voice   Rich with a kind of longing satisfaction:      “To own an eland! That’s what I call life!”   "
"   I   Above the fresh ruffles of the surf   Bright striped urchins flay each other with sand.      They have contrived a conquest for shell shucks,      And their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed      Gaily digging and scattering.   And in answer to their treble interjections      The sun beats lightning on the waves,      The waves fold thunder on the sand;   And could they hear me I would tell them:   O brilliant kids, frisk with your dog,      Fondle your shells and sticks, bleached   By time and the elements; but there is a line      You must not cross nor ever trust beyond it      Spry cordage of your bodies to caresses      Too lichen-faithful from too wide a breast.      The bottom of the sea is cruel.II   —And yet this great wink of eternity,   Of rimless floods, unfettered leewardings,      Samite sheeted and processioned where      Her undinal vast belly moonward bends,      Laughing the wrapt inflections of our love;   Take this Sea, whose diapason knells      On scrolls of silver snowy sentences,   The sceptred terror of whose sessions rends      As her demeanors motion well or ill,      All but the pieties of lovers’ hands.   And onward, as bells off San Salvador      Salute the crocus lustres of the stars,   In these poinsettia meadows of her tides,—   Adagios of islands, O my Prodigal,   Complete the dark confessions her veins spell.   Mark how her turning shoulders wind the hours,      And hasten while her penniless rich palms      Pass superscription of bent foam and wave,—   Hasten, while they are true,—sleep, death, desire,      Close round one instant in one floating flower.   Bind us in time, O Seasons clear, and awe.      O minstrel galleons of Carib fire,   Bequeath us to no earthly shore until   Is answered in the vortex of our grave   The seal’s wide spindrift gaze toward paradise.III   Infinite consanguinity it bears—   This tendered theme of you that light      Retrieves from sea plains where the sky      Resigns a breast that every wave enthrones;      While ribboned water lanes I wind   Are laved and scattered with no stroke      Wide from your side, whereto this hour      The sea lifts, also, reliquary hands.   And so, admitted through black swollen gates      That must arrest all distance otherwise,—   Past whirling pillars and lithe pediments,      Light wrestling there incessantly with light,      Star kissing star through wave on wave unto      Your body rocking!                               and where death, if shed,      Presumes no carnage, but this single change,—   Upon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn      The silken skilled transmemberment of song;   Permit me voyage, love, into your hands ...   IV   Whose counted smile of hours and days, suppose      I know as spectrum of the sea and pledge      Vastly now parting gulf on gulf of wings   Whose circles bridge, I know, (from palms to the severe      Chilled albatross’s white immutability)      No stream of greater love advancing now      Than, singing, this mortality alone      Through clay aflow immortally to you.   All fragrance irrefragably, and claim      Madly meeting logically in this hour      And region that is ours to wreathe again,      Portending eyes and lips and making told      The chancel port and portion of our June—   Shall they not stem and close in our own steps      Bright staves of flowers and quills today as I      Must first be lost in fatal tides to tell?   In signature of the incarnate word   The harbor shoulders to resign in mingling   Mutual blood, transpiring as foreknown   And widening noon within your breast for gathering      All bright insinuations that my years have caught      For islands where must lead inviolably   Blue latitudes and levels of your eyes,—   In this expectant, still exclaim receive      The secret oar and petals of all love.V   Meticulous, past midnight in clear rime,      Infrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast      Together in one merciless white blade—   The bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.   —As if too brittle or too clear to touch!      The cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,   Already hang, shred ends from remembered stars.      One frozen trackless smile ... What words      Can strangle this deaf moonlight? For we   Are overtaken. Now no cry, no sword      Can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,   Slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved      And changed ... “There’s   Nothing like this in the world,” you say,      Knowing I cannot touch your hand and look      Too, into that godless cleft of sky   Where nothing turns but dead sands flashing.   “—And never to quite understand!” No,   In all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed      Nothing so flagless as this piracy.                                                 But now   Draw in your head, alone and too tall here.

Beyond siroccos harvesting   The solstice thunders, crept away,      Like a cliff swinging or a sail   Flung into April’s inmost day—   Creation’s blithe and petalled word      To the lounged goddess when she rose      Conceding dialogue with eyes   That smile unsearchable repose—   Still fervid covenant, Belle Isle,      —Unfolded floating dais before   Which rainbows twine continual hair—   Belle Isle, white echo of the oar!

   There was a little turtle.   He lived in a box.   He swam in a puddle.   He climbed on the rocks.   He snapped at a mosquito.   He snapped at a flea.   He snapped at a minnow.

"   Two old crows sat on a fence rail. Two old crows sat on a fence rail, Thinking of effect and cause, Of weeds and flowers, And nature's laws. One of them muttered, one of them stuttered, One of them stuttered, one of them muttered. Each of them thought far more than he uttered. One crow asked the other crow a riddle. One crow asked the other crow a riddle: The muttering crow Asked the stuttering crow, “Why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle? Why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle?” “Bee-cause,” said the other crow, “Bee-cause, B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B-cause.” Just then a bee flew close to their rail:— “Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZZ.” And those two black crows Turned pale, And away those crows did sail.

"   O Carib Isle!   The tarantula rattling at the lily’s foot   Across the feet of the dead, laid in white sand      Near the coral beach—nor zigzag fiddle crabs      Side-stilting from the path (that shift, subvert   And anagrammatize your name)—No, nothing here      Below the palsy that one eucalyptus lifts      In wrinkled shadows—mourns.                                           And yet suppose   I count these nacreous frames of tropic death,      Brutal necklaces of shells around each grave      Squared off so carefully. Then   To the white sand I may speak a name, fertile   Albeit in a stranger tongue. Tree names, flower names      Deliberate, gainsay death’s brittle crypt. Meanwhile      The wind that knots itself in one great death—   Coils and withdraws. So syllables want breath.   But where is the Captain of this doubloon isle   Without a turnstile? Who but catchword crabs   Patrols the dry groins of the underbrush?   What man, or What   Is Commissioner of mildew throughout the ambushed senses?      His Carib mathematics web the eyes’ baked lenses!   Under the poinciana, of a noon or afternoon   Let fiery blossoms clot the light, render my ghost      Sieved upward, white and black along the air      Until it meets the blue’s comedian host.   Let not the pilgrim see himself again   For slow evisceration bound like those huge terrapin      Each daybreak on the wharf, their brine-caked eyes;   —Spiked, overturned; such thunder in their strain!      And clenched beaks coughing for the surge again!   Slagged of the hurricane—I, cast within its flow,      Congeal by afternoons here, satin and vacant.   You have given me the shell, Satan,—carbonic amulet      Sere of the sun exploded in the sea.   "
"Huffy Henry hid the day,  unappeasable Henry sulked.    I see his point, a trying to put things over.    It was the thought that they thought  they could do it made Henry wicked & away.    But he should have come out and talked.      All the world like a woolen lover  once did seem on Henry's side.    Then came a departure.    Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.    I don't see how Henry, pried  open for all the world to see, survived.      What he has now to say is a long  wonder the world can bear & be.    Once in a sycamore I was glad  all at the top, and I sang.    Hard on the land wears the strong sea  and empty grows every bed."
" There were strange gatherings.   A vote would come  that would be no vote.   There would come a rope.    Yes.   There would come a rope.    Men have their hats down.

It is in the occasions, that not the fathomless heart  the thinky death consists;  his chest is pinched.   The enemy are sick,  and so is us of.   Often, to rising trysts,  like this one, drove he out    and gasps of love, after all, had got him ready.    However things hurt, men hurt worse.   He's stark  to be jerked onward?  Yes.   In the headlights he got' keep him steady,  leak not, look out over.   This' hard work,  boss, wait' for The Word."
"How this woman came by the courage, how she got  the courage, Henry bemused himself in a frantic hot  night of the eight of July,  where it came from, did once the Lord frown down  upon her ancient cradle thinking 'This one  will do before she die    for two and seventy years of chipped indignities  at least,' and with his thunder clapped a promise?  In that far away town  who looky upon my mother with shame & rage  that any should endure such pilgrimage,  growled Henry sweating, grown    but not grown used to the goodness of this woman  in her great strength, in her hope superhuman,  no, no, not used at all.    I declare a mystery, he mumbled to himself,  of love, and took the bourbon from the shelf  and drank her a tall one, tall."

"I consider a song will be as humming-bird  swift, down-light, missile-metal-hard, & strange  as the world of anti-matter  where they are wondering: does time run backward  which the poet thought was true; Scarlatti-supple;  but can Henry write it?    Wreckt, in deep danger, he shook once his head,  returning to meditation.   And word had sped  all from the farthest West  that Henry was desired: can he get free  of the hanging menace, & this all, and go?  He doesn't think so.      Therefore he shakes and he will sing no more,  much less a song as fast as said, as light,  so deep, so flexing.   He broods.

Assembled bands to do obsequious music  at hopeless noon.   He bayed before he obeyed,  doing at last their will.      This seemed perhaps one of the best of dogs  during his barking.   Many thronged & lapped  at his delicious stone.    Cats to a distance kept ""one of their own""  having in mind that down he lay & napped   in the realm of whiskers & fogs."
" Dapples my floor the eastern sun, my house faces north,  I have nothing to say except that it dapples my floor  and it would dapple me  if I lay on that floor, as-well-forthwith  I have done, trying well to mount a thought  not carelessly    in times forgotten, except by the New York Times  which can't forget.   There is always the morgue.    There are men in the morgue.    These men have access.   Sleepless, in position,  they dream the past forever  Colossal in the dawn comes the second light    we do all die, in the floor, in the morgue  and we must die forever, c'est la mort  a heady brilliance  the ultimate gloire  post-mach, probably in underwear  as we met each other once."
" Behold I bring you tidings of great joy""  especially now that the snow & gale are stillÃ¢â‚¬""  for Henry is delivered.    Not only is he delivered from the gale  but he has a little one.   He's out of jail  also.   It is a boy.      Henry's pleasure in this unusual event  reminds me of the extra told at Hollywood & Vine  that TV cameras  were focussed on him personally then & there  and 'Just a few words .     Is it what you meant?  Was there a genuine sign?'    Couvade was always Henry's favourite custom,  better than the bride biting off the penises, pal,  remember? All the brothers  marrying her in turn & dying mutilated  until the youngest put in instead a crowbar, pal,  and pulled out not only her teeth but also his brothers' dongs & no   doubt others'."
"Bards freezing, naked, up to the neck in water,  wholly in dark, time limited, different from  initiations now:  the class in writing, clothed & dry & light,  unlimited time, till Poetry takes some,  nobody reads them though,    no trumpets, no solemn instauration, no change;  no commissions, ladies high in soulful praise  (pal) none,  costumes as usual, turtleneck sweaters, loafers,  in & among the busy Many who brays  art is if anything fun.      I say the subject was given as of old,  prescribed the technical treatment, tests really tests  were set by the masters & graded.    I say the paralyzed fear lest one's not one  is back with us forever, worsts & bests  spring for the public, faded.  "
"Among them marble where the man may lie  lie chieftains grand in final phase, or pause,  'O rare Ben Jonson',  dictator too, & the thinky other Johnson,  dictator too, backhanders down of laws,  men of fears, weird & sly.      Not of these least is borne to rest.    If grandeur & mettle prompted his lone journey  neither oh crowded shelved   nor this slab I celebrates attest  his complex slow fame forever (more or less).    I imagine the Abbey     among their wonders will be glad of him  whom some are sorry for his griefs across the world  grievously understated  and grateful for that bounty, for bright whims  of heavy mind across the tiresome world   which the tiresome world debated, complicated."
" 'A letter from my love to-day!  Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!'  She struck a happy tear away,  And broke the crimson seal.      'My love, there is no help on earth,  No help in heaven; the dead-man's bell  Must toll our wedding; our first hearth  Must be the well-paved floor of hell.'    The colour died from out her face,  Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;  She cast dread looks about the place,  Then clenched her teeth and read right on.      'I may not pass the prison door;  Here must I rot from day to day,  Unless I wed whom I abhor,  My cousin, Blanche of Valencay.      'At midnight with my dagger keen,  I'll take my life; it must be so.    Meet me in hell to-night, my queen,  For weal and woe.'    She laughed although her face was wan,  She girded on her golden belt,  She took her jewelled ivory fan,  And at her glowing missal knelt.      Then rose, 'And am I mad?' she said:  She broke her fan, her belt untied;  With leather girt herself instead,  And stuck a dagger at her side.      She waited, shuddering in her room,  Till sleep had fallen on all the house.    She never flinched; she faced her doom:  They two must sin to keep their vows.      Then out into the night she went,  And, stooping, crept by hedge and tree;  Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,  And caught a happy memory.      She fell, and lay a minute's space;  She tore the sward in her distress;  The dewy grass refreshed her face;  She rose and ran with lifted dress.      She started like a morn-caught ghost  Once when the moon came out and stood  To watch; the naked road she crossed,  And dived into the murmuring wood.      The branches snatched her streaming cloak;  A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!  She hurried to the trysting-oak -   Right well she knew the way.      Without a pause she bared her breast,  And drove her dagger home and fell,  And lay like one that takes her rest,  And died and wakened up in hell.      She bathed her spirit in the flame,  And near the centre took her post;  From all sides to her ears there came  The dreary anguish of the lost.      The devil started at her side,  Comely, and tall, and black as jet.    'I am young Malespina's bride;  Has he come hither yet?'    'My poppet, welcome to your bed.'  'Is Malespina here?'  'Not he! To-morrow he must wed  His cousin Blanche, my dear!'    'You lie, he died with me to-night.'  'Not he! it was a plot' ...   'You lie.'  'My dear, I never lie outright.'  'We died at midnight, he and I.'    The devil went.   Without a groan  She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,  Took root in hell's midst all alone,  And waited for him there.      She dared to make herself at home  Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir.    The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,  Scentless and silent, shrouded her.      How long she stayed I cannot tell;  But when she felt his perfidy,  She marched across the floor of hell;  And all the damned stood up to see.      The devil stopped her at the brink:  She shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'  'My dear, you have gone mad, I think.'  'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'    Across the weltering deep she ran;  A stranger thing was never seen:  The damned stood silent to a man;  They saw the great gulf set between.      To her it seemed a meadow fair;  And flowers sprang up about her feet  She entered heaven; she climbed the stair  And knelt down at the mercy-seat.      Seraphs and saints with one great voice  Welcomed that soul that knew not fear.    Amazed to find it could rejoice,  Hell raised a hoarse, half-human cheer."
" I hang about the streets all day,  At night I hang about;  I sleep a little when I may,  But rise betimes the morning's scout;  For through the year I always hear  Afar, aloft, a ghostly shout.      My clothes are worn to threads and loops;  My skin shows here and there ;  About my face like seaweed droops  My tangled beard, my tangled hair;  From cavernous and shaggy brows  My stony eyes untroubled stare.      I move from eastern wretchedness  Through Fleet Street and the Strand;  And as the pleasant people press  I touch them softly with my hand,  Perhaps I know that still I go  Alive about a living land.      For far in front the clouds are riven  I hear the ghostly cry,  As if a still voice fell from heaven  To where sea-whelmed the drowned folk lie  In sepulchres no tempest stirs  And only eyeless things pass by.      In Piccadilly spirits pass:  Oh, eyes and cheeks that glow!  Oh, strength and comeliness! Alas,  The lustrous health is earth I know  From shrinking eyes that recognise  No brother in my rags and woe.      I know no handicraft, no art,  But I have conquered fate;  For I have chosen the better part,  And neither hope, nor fear, nor hate.    With placid breath on pain and death,  My certain alms, alone I wait.      And daily, nightly comes the call,  The pale unechoing note,  The faint ""Aha!"" sent from the wall  Of heaven, but from no ruddy throat  Of human breed or seraph's seed,  A phantom voice that cries by rote."
"The war of words is done;  The red-lipped cannon speak;  The battle has begun.      The web your speeches spun  Tears and blood shall streak;  The war of words is done.      Smoke enshrouds the sun;  Earth staggers at the shriek  Of battle new begun.      Poltroons and braggarts run:  Woe to the poor, the meek!  The war of words is done.      ""And hope not now to shun  The doom that dogs the weak,""  Thunders every gun;    ""Victory must be won.  ""  When the red-lipped cannon speak,  The war of words is done,  The slaughter has begun."
"The war of words is done;  The red-lipped cannon speak;  The battle has begun.      The web your speeches spun  Tears and blood shall streak;  The war of words is done.

"There is a dish to hold the sea,   A brazier to contain the sun,   A compass for the galaxy,   A voice to wake the dead and done!     That minister of ministers,   Imagination, gathers up   The undiscovered Universe,   Like jewels in a jasper cup.       Its flame can mingle north and south;   Its accent with the thunder strive;   The ruddy sentence of its mouth   Can make the ancient dead alive.       The mart of power, the fount of will,   The form and mould of every star,   The source and bound of good and ill,   The key of all the things that are,     Imagination, new and strange   In every age, can turn the year;   Can shift the poles and lightly change   The mood of men, the world's career."
" As I went down to Dymchurch Wall,  I heard the South sing o'er the land  I saw the yellow sunlight fall  On knolls where Norman churches stand.      And ringing shrilly, taut and lithe,  Within the wind a core of sound,  The wire from Romney town to Hythe  Along its airy journey wound.      A veil of purple vapour flowed  And trailed its fringe along the Straits;  The upper air like sapphire glowed:  And roses filled Heaven's central gates.      Masts in the offing wagged their tops;  The swinging waves pealed on the shore;  The saffron beach, all diamond drops  And beads of surge, prolonged the roar.      As I came up from Dymchurch Wall,  I saw above the Downs' low crest  The crimson brands of sunset fall,  Flicker and fade from out the West.      Night sank: like flakes of silver fire  The stars in one great shower came down;  Shrill blew the wind; and shrill the wire  Rang out from Hythe to Romney town.      The darkly shining salt sea drops  Streamed as the waves clashed on the shore;  The beach, with all its organ stops  Pealing again, prolonged the roar."
" 'Who affirms that crystals are alive?'  I affirm it, let who will deny:  Crystals are engendered, wax and thrive,  Wane and wither; I have seen them die.      Trust me, masters, crystals have their day,  Eager to attain the perfect norm,  Lit with purpose, potent to display  Facet, angle, colour, beauty, form.      Water-crystals need for flower and root  Sixty clear degrees, no less, no more;  Snow, so fickle, still in this acute  Angle thinks, and learns no other lore:    Such its life, and such its pleasure is,  Such its art and traffic, such its gain,  Evermore in new conjunctions this  Admirable angle to maintain.      Crystalcraft in every flower and flake  Snow exhibits, of the welkin free:  Crystalline are crystals for the sake,  All and singular, of crystalry.      Yet does every crystal of the snow  Individualize, a seedling sown  Broadcast, but instinct with power to grow  Beautiful in beauty of its own.      Every flake with all its prongs and dints  Burns ecstatic as a new-lit star:  Men are not more diverse, finger prints  More dissimilar than snow-flakes are.      Worlds of men and snow endure, increase,  Woven of power and passion to defy  Time and travail: only races cease,  Individual men and crystals die."
"A monster taught   To come to hand   Amain,   As swift as thought   Across the land   The train.       The song it sings   Has an iron sound;   Its iron wings   Like wheels go round.       Crash under bridges,   Flash over ridges,   And vault the downs;   The road is straight --   Nor stile, nor gate;   For milestones -- towns!     Voluminous, vanishing, white,   The steam plume trails;   Parallel streaks of light,   THe polished rails.       Oh, who can follow?   The little swallow,   The trout of the sky:   But the sun   Is outrun,   And Time passed by.       O'er bosky dens,   By marsh and mead,   Forest and fens   Embodied speed   Is clanked and hurled;   O'er rivers and runnels;   And into the earth   And out again   In death and birth   That know no pain,   For the whole round world   Is a warren of railway tunnels.       Hark! hark! hark!   It screams and cleaves the dark;   And the subterranean night   Is gilt with smoky light.     Then out again apace   It runs its thundering race,   The monster taught   To come to hand   Amain,   That swift as thought   Speeds through the land   The train.  "
" 'O WHICH is the last rose?'   A blossom of no name.     At midnight the snow came;   At daybreak a vast rose,   In darkness unfurl'd,   O'er-petall'd the world.       Its odourless pallor   Blossom'd forlorn,   Till radiant valour   Establish'd the morn--   Till the night   Was undone   In her fight   With the sun.       The brave orb in state rose,   And crimson he shone first;   While from the high vine   Of heaven the dawn burst,   Staining the great rose   From sky-line to sky-line.       The red rose of morn   A white rose at noon turn'd;   But at sunset reborn   All red again soon burn'd.     Then the pale rose of noonday   Rebloom'd in the night,   And spectrally white    In the light   Of the moon lay.       But the vast rose    Was scentless,   And this is the reason:   When the blast rose    Relentless,   And brought in due season   The snow rose, the last rose   Congeal'd in its breath,   Then came with it treason;   The traitor was Death.       In lee-valleys crowded,   The sheep and the birds   Were frozen and shrouded   In flights and in herds.     In highways   And byways   The young and the old   Were tortured and madden'd   And kill'd by the cold.     But many were gladden'd   By the beautiful last rose,   The blossom of no name   That came when the snow came,   In darkness unfurl'd--   The wonderful vast rose   That fill'd all the world."
" I couldn't touch a stop and turn a screw,  And set the blooming world a-work for me,  Like such as cut their teeth -- I hope, like you --  On the handle of a skeleton gold key;  I cut mine on a leek, which I eat it every week:  I'm a clerk at thirty bob as you can see.      But I don't allow it's luck and all a toss;  There's no such thing as being starred and crossed;  It's just the power of some to be a boss,  And the bally power of others to be bossed:  I face the music, sir; you bet I ain't a cur;  Strike me lucky if I don't believe I'm lost!    For like a mole I journey in the dark,  A-travelling along the underground  From my Pillar'd Halls and broad Suburbean Park,  To come the daily dull official round;  And home again at night with my pipe all alight,  A-scheming how to count ten bob a pound.      And it's often very cold and very wet,  And my missus stitches towels for a hunks;  And the Pillar'd Halls is half of it to let--  Three rooms about the size of travelling trunks.    And we cough, my wife and I, to dislocate a sigh,  When the noisy little kids are in their bunks.      But you never hear her do a growl or whine,  For she's made of flint and roses, very odd;  And I've got to cut my meaning rather fine,  Or I'd blubber, for I'm made of greens and sod:  So p'r'haps we are in Hell for all that I can tell,  And lost and damn'd and served up hot to God.      I ain't blaspheming, Mr.   Silver-tongue;  I'm saying things a bit beyond your art:  Of all the rummy starts you ever sprung,  Thirty bob a week's the rummiest start!  With your science and your books and your the'ries about spooks,  Did you ever hear of looking in your heart?    I didn't mean your pocket, Mr.  , no:  I mean that having children and a wife,  With thirty bob on which to come and go,  Isn't dancing to the tabor and the fife:  When it doesn't make you drink, by Heaven! it makes you think,  And notice curious items about life.      I step into my heart and there I meet  A god-almighty devil singing small,  Who would like to shout and whistle in the street,  And squelch the passers flat against the wall;  If the whole world was a cake he had the power to take,  He would take it, ask for more, and eat them all.      And I meet a sort of simpleton beside,  The kind that life is always giving beans;  With thirty bob a week to keep a bride  He fell in love and married in his teens:  At thirty bob he stuck; but he knows it isn't luck:  He knows the seas are deeper than tureens.      And the god-almighty devil and the fool  That meet me in the High Street on the strike,  When I walk about my heart a-gathering wool,  Are my good and evil angels if you like.    And both of them together in every kind of weather  Ride me like a double-seated bike.      That's rough a bit and needs its meaning curled.    But I have a high old hot un in my mind --  A most engrugious notion of the world,  That leaves your lightning 'rithmetic behind:  I give it at a glance when I say 'There ain't no chance,  Nor nothing of the lucky-lottery kind.  '    And it's this way that I make it out to be:  No fathers, mothers, countres, climates -- none;  Not Adam was responsible for me,  Nor society, nor systems, nary one:  A little sleeping seed, I woke -- I did, indeed --  A million years before the blooming sun.      I woke because I thought the time had come;  Beyond my will there was no other cause;  And everywhere I found myself at home,  Because I chose to be the thing I was;  And in whatever shape of mollusc or of ape  I always went according to the laws.      I was the love that chose my mother out;  I joined two lives and from the union burst;  My weakness and my strength without a doubt  Are mine alone for ever from the first:  It's just the very same with a difference in the name  As 'Thy will be done.  ' You say it if you durst!    They say it daily up and down the land  As easy as you take a drink, it's true;  But the difficultest go to understand,  And the difficultest job a man can do,  Is to come it brave and meek with thirty bob a week,  And feel that that's the proper thing for you.      It's a naked child against a hungry wolf;  It's playing bowls upon a splitting wreck;  It's walking on a string across a gulf  With millstones fore-and-aft about your neck;  But the thing is daily done by many and many a one;  And we fall, face forward, fighting, on the deck.  "
"Goodbye, my friend, goodbye  My love, you are in my heart.    It was preordained we should part  And be reunited by and by.    Goodbye: no handshake to endure.    Let's have no sadness furrowed brow.    There's nothing new in dying now  Though living is no newer."
"Are you still alive, my dear granny?  I am alive as well. Hello! Hello!  May there always be above you, honey,  The amazing stream of evening glow.     I""ve been told that hiding your disquiet,  Worrying  about me a lot,  You go out  to the roadside every night,  Wearing your shabby overcoat.     In the evening  darkness, very often,  You conceive the same old scene of blood:  Kind of in a tavern fight  some ruffian  Plunged a Finnish knife into my heart.     Now calm down, mom! And don't be dreary!  It's a painful fiction through and through.  I'm not so bad a drunkard, really,  As to die without seeing you.     I'm your tender son  as ever, dear,  And the only thing I dream of now  Is to leave this dismal boredom here  And return to our little house. And how!     I'll return in spring without warning  When the garden blossoms, white as snow.  Please don't wake me early in the morning,  As you did before, eight years ago.    1924     Don't disturb my dreams that now have flown,  Don't  perturb my vain and futile strife  For it's much too early that I've known  Heavy loss and weariness in life.     Please don't teach me how to say my prayers!  There is no way back to what is gone.  You're my only joy, support and praise  And my only flare shining on.     Please  forget about your pain and fear,  and don't  worry  over me a lot  Don't go out  to the roadside, dear,  Wearing your shabby overcoat."
"Yes! It's settled! Now and for ever  I have left my dear old plain.  And the winged leaves of poplars will never  Ring and rustle above me again.     Our house will sag in my absence,  And my dog died a long time ago.  Me, I'm fated to die with  compassions  In the crooked streets of Moscow, I know.     I admire this city of elm-trees  With decrepit buildings and homes.  Golden somnolent Asian entities  Are reposing on temple domes.     When the moonlight at night, dissipated,  Shines... like hell in the dark sky of blue!  I walk down the alley, dejected,  To the pub for a drink, maybe, two.     It's a sinister den,  harsh and roaring,  But in spite of it, all through the night  I read poems for girls that go whoring  And carouse with thieves with delight.     Now I speak but my words are quite pointless,  And the beat  of my heart is fast:  ""Just like you, I am totally worthless,  And I cannot re-enter the past"".  Our house will sag in my absence.  And my dog died a long time ago.  Me, I'm fated to die with  compassions  In the crooked streets of Moscow, I know."
"Here is this happiness  -  silly  -   Windows looking out to the lawn.  The sunset is peaceful, it’s gliding  On the lake like a scarlet-necked swan.    Greetings to you, golden stillness,  The birch, white and svelte as a stork.  Over the roof, a flock of jackdaws  Tends vespers to Lodestar.    Coyly, somewhere in the garden  Right where the guelder rose blooms,  A delicate girl in a white gown  -   Chants her delicate tunes.    Grey haze ascends from the pastures;  Little night cold slowly creeps.  Happiness  -  silly and precious  -   The innocent rose of your cheeks"
"Shaganet, o my love, Shaganet!  You will know because I am Nordic;  I can tell you a meadow, most scenic,  Moonlit rye waves one cannot forget.  Shaganet, o my love, Shaganet,    You will know because I am Nordic;  So bright shines the moon out there  That it may outglow any glare  Of Shiraz blazing forth from its tunic.  You will know because I am Nordic;    I can tell you a meadow, most scenic,  For my hair was gifted from rye,  Twixt your fingers you may intertwine -  I don’t feel any pain, any heartache.  I can tell you a meadow, most scenic.    Moonlit rye waves, one cannot forget,  Look so much like my curly hair, darling.  Oh, my love, please keep joking and smiling,  But don’t let me think of the silhouette  Of the rye waves, one cannot forget.    Shaganet, o my love, Shaganet!  There, up north, lives a maiden who also  Does resemble you terribly close,  May be now she’s thinking of meâ€¦  Shaganet, o my love, Shaganet."
"Don't you force a smile, girl, tensely, like you do,  the one I'm in love with isn't really you.    I suppose you know it, and you know it well,  I'm not here to see you but another girl.    I was passing by, and, well, I didn't care,  I saw you and wanted just to stop and stare."
"I do not regret, and I do not shed tears,  all, like haze off apple-trees, must pass.  Turning gold, I’m fading, it appears,  I will not be young again, alas.    Having got to know the touch of coolness  I will not feel, as before, so good.  And the land of birch trees - oh my goodness!  Cannot make me wander barefoot.    Vagrant’s spirit! You do not so often  stir the fire of my lips these days.  Oh my freshness, that begins to soften!  Oh my lost emotions, vehement gaze!    Presently I do not feel a yearning,  oh, my life! Have I been sleeping fast?  Well, it feels like early in the morning  on a rosy horse I’ve galloped past.    We are all to perish, hoping for some favour,  golden leaves flow down turning grey.  May you be redeemed and blessed for ever,  you who came to bloom and pass awayâ€¦"
"Don't you look at me so reproachfully.  I do not bear malice to you,  but I like your appearance awfully  and your seeming modesty, too.    Yes, you seem to be openhearted,  and I'd rather be glad to see  how a fox pretending departed  catches crows like you want to catch me.    Try to catch me, I won't be daunted  mind, you don't have your ardour restrained!  Many girls of your kind have haunted  stumbling over my heart that waned.    It's not you that I love, my dearie,  you're only an echo, a shade,  I imagine a different girlie,  oh so beautiful blue-eyed maid!    Though she isn't so humble-looking  and appears to be rather cool,  her majestic manner of walking  has rekindled the depth of my soul.    She's a girl that cannot be cheated,  not withstanding your will she'll entice,  whereas you can't be possibly fitted  in my heart with embellished lies.    Though I scorn you, yet like a layman  I will shyly and openly say:  If there weren't any hell and heaven  man would think something up anyway"
"I haven't forgotten you, dearie,  the shine of your hair and all.  It wasn't so easy and cheery  to leave you, as I recall.    I haven't forgotten the autumn,  the rustle of birches, the night;  And though the days were shorter  the moonlight was long and bright.    You whispered these words in my ear:  The years and the dreams will be gone,  you'll go with another, my dear,  and leave me all on my own'.    That lime standing there, in flower,  reminds my emotion anew  the way I would tenderly shower  those beautiful flowers on you.    My heart will be warm, sad and sorry,  in love, remembering well  you, friend, as a fanciful story  of love with another girl."
"The golden birch-tree grove has fallen silent  it's merry chatter having stopped afore,  the cranes up there flying over, sullen,  have nobody to pity any more.    Whom should they pity? Each is just a trotter.  One comes and goes and leaves for good again.  The moon and hempen bush above the water  remember all those perished, filled with pain.    I'm standing on the plain all on my own,  the cranes, the wind is taking them away,  I think about my boyhood which has flown,  and I do not regret my bygones anyway.    I don't regret the days that I discarded,  I don't feel sorry for the lilac of my soul.  The purple rowan burning in the garden  can't warm and comfort anyone at all.    The rowan will maintain its coloration.  The grass exposed to heat will not decease,  I drop my words of sorrow and vexation  the way a tree drops quietly its leaves.

"It's sad to look at you, my love,  and it's so painful to remember!  It seems, the only thing we have  is tint of willow in September.    Somebody's lips have outworn  your warmth and body trepidation,  as if the rain was drizzling down  the soul, that stiffened in congestion.    Well, let it be! I do not dread.  I have some other joyous gala.  There's nothing left for me except  for brown dust and grizzly colour.    I've been unable, to my rue,  to save myself, for smiles or any.  The roads that have been walked are few  mistakes that have been made are many.    With funny life and funny split  so it has been and will be ever.  The grove with birch-tree bones in it  is like a graveyard, well I never!    Likewise, we'll go to our doom  and fade, like callers of the garden.  In winter flowers never bloom,  and so we shouldn't grieve about them."
"I’m tired of living in my land  with boring fields and buckwheat fragrant,  I’ll leave my home for ever, and  begin the life of thief and vagrant.    I’ll walk through silver curls of life  in search of miserable dwelling.  My dearest friend will whet his knife  on me. The reason? There’s no telling.    The winding yellow road will go  across the sunlit field of flowers,  the girl whose name I cherish so  will turn me out of her house.    I will return back home to live  and see the others feeling happy,  I’ll hang myself upon my sleeve,  on a green evening it will happen.    The silky willows by the fence  qill bend their tops low down, gently,  to dogs’ barking, by my friends,  unwashed, I will be buried plainly.    The moon will float up in the sky  dropping the oars into the waterâ€¦  As ever, Russia will get by  and dance and weep in every quarter.    bio    9 / 24    Bloom And Pass Away Don't You Force A Smile Don't You Look At Me So Goodbuy My Friend I Haven't Forgotten You In The Prime Of Fall In Winter Flower Never Bloom It's Settled Leaving Let's Sit Down Here My Dearest Letter To Mother My Love Has Changed Scarlet Light Of Sunset Sing On A Cursed Guitar Spring And Love That Lasts The Bitch The Flower Say Goodbuy The Night Transience Tree Horse Sleigh What Is Gone Can't Be Retrieved White Sweatshirt You Don't Love Me You Were Crying  "
"Lay a garland on my herse   Of the dismal yew;  Maidens, willow branches bear;   Say, I died true.      My love was false, but I was firm   From my hour of birth.    Upon my buried body lie   Lightly, gentle earth!"
"AWAY, delights! go seek some other dwelling,   For I must die.    Farewell, false love! thy tongue is ever telling   Lie after lie.    For ever let me rest now from thy smarts;   Alas, for pity go   And fire their hearts  That have been hard to thee! Mine was not so.      Never again deluding love shall know me,   For I will die;  And all those griefs that think to overgrow me   Shall be as I:  For ever will I sleep, while poor maids cry--   'Alas, for pity stay,   And let us die  With thee! Men cannot mock us in the clay.'  "
"BEAUTY clear and fair,   Where the air  Rather like a perfume dwells;   Where the violet and the rose   Their blue veins and blush disclose,  And come to honour nothing else:     Where to live near   And planted there  Is to live, and still live new;   Where to gain a favour is   More than light, perpetual bliss--  Make me live by serving you!    Dear, again back recall   To this light,  A stranger to himself and all!   Both the wonder and the story   Shall be yours, and eke the glory;  I am your servant, and your thrall."
"ROSES, their sharp spines being gone,   Not royal in their smells alone,    But in their hue;   Maiden pinks, of odour faint,   Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,    And sweet thyme true;     Primrose, firstborn child of Ver;   Merry springtime's harbinger,    With her bells dim;   Oxlips in their cradles growing,   Marigolds on death-beds blowing,    Larks'-heels trim;     All dear Nature's children sweet   Lie 'fore bride and bridegroom's feet,    Blessing their sense!   Not an angel of the air,   Bird melodious or bird fair,    Be absent hence!

"Care-charming Sleep, thou easer of all woes,  Brother to Death, sweetly thyself dispose  On this afflicted prince; fall like a cloud  In gentle showers; give nothing that is loud  Or painful to his slumbers; easy, sweet,  And as a purling stream, thou son of Night,  Pass by his troubled senses; sing his pain,  Like hollow murmuring wind or silver rain;  Into this prince gently, oh gently slide,  And kiss him into slumbers like a bride.

" GOD Lyaeus, ever young,  Ever honour'd, ever sung,  Stain'd with blood of lusty grapes,  In a thousand lusty shapes  Dance upon the mazer's brim,  In the crimson liquor swim;  From thy plenteous hand divine  Let a river run with wine:   God of youth, let this day here   Enter neither care nor fear."
"HEAR, ye ladies that despise   What the mighty Love has done;  Fear examples and be wise:   Fair Callisto was a nun;  Leda, sailing on the stream   To deceive the hopes of man,  Love accounting but a dream,   Doted on a silver swan;   Danae, in a brazen tower,   Where no love was, loved a shower.      Hear, ye ladies that are coy,   What the mighty Love can do;  Fear the fierceness of the boy:   The chaste Moon he makes to woo;  Vesta, kindling holy fires,   Circled round about with spies,  Never dreaming loose desires,   Doting at the altar dies;   Ilion, in a short hour, higher   He can build, and once more fire."
"Hence, all you vain delights,  As short as are the nights  Wherein you spend your folly:  There's nought in this life sweet,  If man were wise to see't,  But only melancholy,  O sweetest melancholy!  Welcome, folded arms, and fixed eyes,  A sigh that piercing mortifies,  A look that's fastened to the ground,  A tongue chained up without a sound;  Fountain-heads, and pathless groves,  Places which pale passion loves;  Moonlight walks, when all the fowls  Are warmly housed, save bats and owls;  A midnight bell, a parting groan:  These are the sounds we feed upon;  Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley,  Nothing's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy."
"NOW the lusty spring is seen;   Golden yellow, gaudy blue,   Daintily invite the view:  Everywhere on every green  Roses blushing as they blow,   And enticing men to pull,  Lilies whiter than the snow,   Woodbines of sweet honey full:   All love's emblems, and all cry,   'Ladies, if not pluck'd, we die.  '    Yet the lusty spring hath stay'd;   Blushing red and purest white   Daintily to love invite  Every woman, every maid:  Cherries kissing as they grow,   And inviting men to taste,  Apples even ripe below,   Winding gently to the waist:   All love's emblems, and all cry,   'Ladies, if not pluck'd, we die."
" HENCE, all you vain delights,   As short as are the nights   Wherein you spend your folly!  There 's naught in this life sweet,  If men were wise to see't,   But only melancholy--   O sweetest melancholy!  Welcome, folded arms and fixed eyes,  A sight that piercing mortifies,  A look that 's fasten'd to the ground,  A tongue chain'd up without a sound!    Fountain-heads and pathless groves,  Places which pale passion loves!  Moonlight walks, when all the fowls  Are warmly housed, save bats and owls!   A midnight bell, a parting groan--   These are the sounds we feed upon:  Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley,  Nothing 's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.  "
" In the night of weariness   let me give myself up to sleep without struggle,   resting my trust upon thee.       Let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy worship.       It is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day   to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening."
"she was a short one  getting fat and she had once been  beautiful and  she drank the wine  she drank the wine in bed and  talked and screamed and cursed at  me  and i told her   please, I need some  sleep.     -sleep? sleep? ya son of a  bitch, ya never sleep, ya  don't need any  sleep!   I buried her one morning early  I carried her down the sides of the Hollywood Hills  brambles and rabbits and rocks  running in front of me  and by the time I'd dug the ditch  and stuck her in  belly down  and put the dirt back on  the sun was up and it was warm  and the flies were lazy and  I could hardly see anything out of my eyes  everything was so  warm and yellow.     I managed to drive home and I got into bed and I  slept for 5 days and 4  nights."
"Do you give yourself to me utterly,    Body and no-body, flesh and no-flesh    Not as a fugitive, blindly or bitterly,     But as a child might, with no other wish?    Yes, utterly.          Then I shall bear you down my estuary,    Carry you and ferry you to burial mysteriously,    Take you and receive you,    Consume you, engulf you,    In the huge cave, my belly, lave you    With huger waves continually.      And you shall cling and clamber there    And slumber there, in that dumb chamber,    Beat with my blood's beat, hear my heart move    Blindly in bones that ride above you,    Delve in my flesh, dissolved and bedded,    Through viewless valves embodied so -        Till daylight, the expulsion and awakening,    The riving and the driving forth,    Life with remorseless forceps beckoning -    Pangs and betrayal of harsh birth.  "
"COME, Sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving  Lock me in delight awhile;  Let some pleasing dreams beguile  All my fancies; that from thence  I may feel an influence  All my powers of care bereaving!    Though but a shadow, but a sliding,  Let me know some little joy!  We that suffer long annoy  Are contented with a thought  Through an idle fancy wrought:  O let my joys have some abiding"
"To what purpose, April, do you return again?  Beauty is not enough.    You can no longer quiet me with the redness  Of little leaves opening stickily.    I know what I know.    The sun is hot on my neck as I observe  The spikes of the crocus.    The smell of the earth is good.    It is apparent that there is no death.    But what does that signify?  Not only under ground are the brains of men  Eaten by maggots.    Life in itself  Is nothing,  An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.    It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,  April  Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers."
"Birds' love and birds' song  Flying here and there,  Birds' songand birds' love  And you with gold for hair!  Birds' songand birds' love  Passing with the weather,  Men's song and men's love,  To love once and forever.      Men's love and birds' love,  And women's love and men's!  And you my wren with a crown of gold,  You my queen of the wrens!  You the queen of the wrens --  We'll be birds of a feather,  I'll be King of the Queen of the wrens,  And all in a nest together."

Merry voice  Infant noise  Merrily Merrily to welcome in the Year    Little Lamb  Here I am.    Come and lick  My white neck.    Let me pull  Your soft Wool.    Let me kiss  Your soft face  Merrily Merrily we welcome in the Year"
"WEEP no more, nor sigh, nor groan,  Sorrow calls no time that 's gone:  Violets pluck'd, the sweetest rain  Makes not fresh nor grow again.    Trim thy locks, look cheerfully;  Fate's hid ends eyes cannot see.    Joys as winged dreams fly fast,  Why should sadness longer last?  Grief is but a wound to woe;"
"A bird that I don't know,  Hunched on his light-pole like a scarecrow,  Looks sideways out into the wheat  The wind waves under the waves of heat.    The field is yellow as egg-bread dough  Except where (just as though they'd let  It live for looks) a locust billows  In leaf-green and shade-violet,  A standing mercy.    The bird calls twice, ""Red clay, red clay"";  Or else he's saying, ""Directly, directly.  ""  If someone came by I could ask,  Around here all of them must know --  And why they live so and die so --  Or why, for once, the lagging heron  Flaps from the little creek's parched cresses  Across the harsh-grassed, gullied meadow  To the black, rowed evergreens below.    They know and they don't know.    To ask, a man must be a stranger --  And asking, much more answering, is dangerous;  Asked about it, who would not repent  Of all he ever did and never meant,  And think a life and its distresses,  Its random, clutched-for, homefelt blisses,  The circumstances of an accident?  The farthest farmer in a field,  A gaunt plant grown, for seed, by farmers,  Has felt a longing, lorn urbanity  Jailed in his breast; and, just as I,  Has grunted, in his old perplexity,  A standing plea.    From the tar of the blazing square  The eyes shift, in their taciturn  And unavowing, unavailable sorrow.    Yet the intonation of a name confesses  Some secrets that they never meant  To let out to a soul; and what words would not dim  The bowed and weathered heads above the denim  Or the once-too-often washed wash dresses?  They are subdued to their own element.    One day  The red, clay face  Is lowered to the naked clay;  After some words, the body is forsaken  The shadows lengthen, and a dreaming hope  Breathes, from the vague mound, Life;  From the grove under the spire  Stars shine, and a wandering light  Is kindled for the mourner, man.    The angel kneeling with the wreath  Sees, in the moonlight, graves.  "
"The postman comes when I am still in bed.    ""Postman, what do you have for me today?""  I say to him.   (But really I'm in bed.  )  Then he says - what shall I have him say?    ""This letter says that you are president  Of - this word here; it's a republic.  ""  Tell them I can't answer right away.    ""It's your duty.  "" No, I'd rather just be sick.      Then he tells me there are letters saying everything  That I can think of that I want for them to say.    I say, ""Well, thank you very much.   Good-bye.  ""  He is ashamed, and turns and walks away.      If I can think of it, it isn't what I want.    I want .   .   .   I want a ship from some near star  To land in the yard, and beings to come out  And think to me: ""So this is where you are!    Come.  "" Except that they won't do,  I thought of them.   .   .   .   And yet somewhere there must be  Something that's different from everything.    All that I've never thought of - think of me!  "
"With beasts and gods, above, the wall is bright.    The child's head, bent to the book-colored shelves,  Is slow and sidelong and food-gathering,  Moving in blind grace .  .  .   yet from the mural, Care  The grey-eyed one, fishing the morning mist,  Seizes the baby hero by the hair  And whispers, in the tongue of gods and children,  Words of a doom as ecumenical as dawn  But blanched like dawn, with dew.    The children's cries  Are to men the cries of crickets, dense with warmth  -- But dip a finger into Fafnir, taste it,  And all their words are plain as chance and pain.    Their tales are full of sorcerers and ogres  Because their lives are: the capricious infinite  That, like parents, no one has yet escaped  Except by luck or magic; and since strength  And wit are useless, be kind or stupid, wait  Some power's gratitude, the tide of things.    Read meanwhile .  .  .   hunt among the shelves, as dogs do, grasses,  And find one cure for Everychild's diseases  Beginning: Once upon a time there was  A wolf that fed, a mouse that warned, a bear that rode  A boy.   Us men, alas! wolves, mice, bears bore.    And yet wolves, mice, bears, children, gods and men  In slow preambulation up and down the shelves  Of the universe are seeking .  .  .   who knows except themselves?  What some escape to, some escape: if we find Swann's  Way better than our own, an trudge on at the back  Of the north wind to -- to -- somewhere east  Of the sun, west of the moon, it is because we live  By trading another's sorrow for our own; another's  Impossibilities, still unbelieved in, for our own .  .  .    ""I am myself still?"" For a little while, forget:  The world's selves cure that short disease, myself,  And we see bending to us, dewy-eyed, the great  CHANGE, dear to all things not to themselves endeared."
"er imaginary playmate was a grown-up   In sea-coal satin.   The flame-blue glances,   The wings gauzy as the membrane that the ashes   Draw over an old ember --as the mother   In a jug of cider-- were a comfort to her.     They sat by the fire and told each other stories.       ""What men want.  .  .  "" said the godmother softly--   How she went on it is hard for a man to say.     Their eyes, on their Father, were monumental marble.     Then they smiled like two old women, bussed each other,   Said, ""Gossip, gossip""; and, lapped in each other's looks,   Mirror for Mirror, drank a cup of tea.       Of cambric tea.   But there is a reality   Under the good silk of the good sisters'   Good ball gowns.   She knew.  .  .   Hard-breasted, naked-eyed,   She pushed her silk feet into glass, and rose within   A gown of imaginary gauze.   The shy prince drank   A toast to her in champagne from her slipper     And breathed, ""Bewitching!"" Breathed, ""I am bewitched!""   --She said to her godmother, ""Men!""   And, later, looking down to see her flesh   Look back up from under lace, the ashy gauze   And pulsing marble of a bridal veil,   She wished it all a widow's coal-black weeds.       A sullen wife and a reluctant mother,   She sat all day in silence by the fire.     Better, later, to stare past her sons' sons,   Her daughters' daughter, and tell stories to the fire.     But best, dead, damned, to rock forever   Beside Hell's fireside-- to see within the flames     The Heaven to whosee gold-gauzed door there comes   A little dark old woman, the God's Mother,   And cries, ""Come in, come in! My son's out now,   Out now, will be back soon, may be back never,   Who knows, eh? We know what they are--men, men!   But come, come in till then! Come in till then!"
"Did they send me away from my cat and my wife  To a doctor who poked me and counted my teeth,  To a line on a plain, to a stove in a tent?  Did I nod in the flies of the schools?  And the fighters rolled into the tracer like rabbits,  The blood froze over my splints like a scab --  Did I snore, all still and grey in the turret,  Till the palms rose out of the sea with my death?  And the world ends here, in the sand of a grave,  All my wars over? How easy it was to die!  Has my wife a pension of so many mice?  Did the medals go home to my cat?  "
"The spirit killeth, but the letter giveth life.    The week is dealt out like a hand  That children pick up card by card.    One keeps getting the same hand.    One keeps getting the same card.    But twice a day -- except on Saturday --  The wheel stops, there is a crack in Time:  With a hiss of soles, a rattle of tin,  My own gray Daemon pauses on the stair,  My own bald Fortune lifts me by the hair.    Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox  Still laughs the postcard, Hope:  Your uncle in Australia  Has died and you are Pope,  For many a soul has entertained  A Mailman unawares --  And as you cry, Impossible,  A step is on the stairs.    One keeps getting the same dream  Delayed, marked ""Payment Due,""  The bill that one has paid  Delayed, marked ""Payment Due"" --  Twice a day, in rotting mailbox,  The white grubs are new:  And Faith, once more, is mine  Faithfully, but Charity  Writes hopefully about a new  Asylum -- but Hope is as good as new.    Woe's me! woe's me! In Folly's mailbox  Still laughs the postcard, Hope:  Your uncle in Australia  Has died and you are Pope,  For many a soul has entertained  A mailman unawares --  And as you cry, Impossible,  A step is on the stairs."
" Each day brings its toad, each night its dragon.    Der heilige Hieronymus--his lion is at the zoo--  Listens, listens.   All the long, soft, summer day  Dreams affright his couch, the deep boils like a pot.    As the sun sets, the last patient rises,  Says to him, Father, trembles, turns away.      Often, to the lion, the saint said, Son.    To the man the saint says--but the man is gone.    Under a plaque of Gradiva, at gloaming.    The old man boils an egg.   When he has eaten  He listens a while.   The patients have not stopped.    At midnight, he lies down where his patients lay.      All night the old man whispers to the night.    It listens evenly.   The great armored paws  Of its forelegs put together in reflection.    It thinks: Where Ego was, there Id shall be.    The world wrestles with it and is changed into it  And after a long time changes it.   The dragon    Listens as the old man says, at dawn: I see  --There is an old man, naked in a desert, by a cliff.    He has set out his books, his hat, his ink, his shears  Among scorpions, toads, the wild beasts of the desert.    I lie beside him--I am a lion.    He kneels listening.   He holds in his left hand    The stone with which he beats his breat, and holds  In his right hand, the pen with which he puts  Into his book, the words of the angel:  The angel up into whose face he looks.    But the angel does not speak.   He looks into the face  Of the night, and the night says--but the night is gone.      He has slept.   .   .   .   At morning, when man's flesh is young  And man's soul thankful for it knows not what,  The air is washed, and smells of boiling coffee,  And the sun lights it.   The old man walks placidly  To the grocer's; walks on, under leaves, in light,  To a lynx, a leopard--he has come;    The man holds out a lump of liver to the lion,  And the lion licks the man's hand with his tongue."
"It was not dying: everybody died.     It was not dying: we had died before   In the routine crashes-- and our fields   Called up the papers, wrote home to our folks,   And the rates rose, all because of us.     We died on the wrong page of the almanac,   Scattered on mountains fifty miles away;   Diving on haystacks, fighting with a friend,   We blazed up on the lines we never saw.     We died like aunts or pets or foreigners.     (When we left high school nothing else had died   For us to figure we had died like.  )     In our new planes, with our new crews, we bombed   The ranges by the desert or the shore,   Fired at towed targets, waited for our scores--   And turned into replacements and worke up   One morning, over England, operational.       It wasn't different: but if we died   It was not an accident but a mistake   (But an easy one for anyone to make.  )   We read our mail and counted up our missions--   In bombers named for girls, we burned   The cities we had learned about in school--   Till our lives wore out; our bodies lay among   The people we had killed and never seen.     When we lasted long enough they gave us medals;   When we died they said, ""Our casualties were low.  ""     The said, ""Here are the maps""; we burned the cities.       It was not dying --no, not ever dying;   But the night I died I dreamed that I was dead,   And the cities said to me: ""Why are you dying?   We are satisfied, if you are; but why did I die?"""
" The letters always just evade the hand  One skates like a stone into a beam, falls like a bird.    Surely the past from which the letters rise  Is waiting in the future, past the graves?  The soldiers are all haunted by their lives.    Their claims upon their kind are paid in paper  That established a presence, like a smell.    In letters and in dreams they see the world.    They are waiting: and the years contract  To an empty hand, to one unuttered sound --  The soldier simply wishes for his name."
"Moving from Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All,  I take a box  And add it to my wild rice, my Cornish game hens.    The slacked or shorted, basketed, identical  Food-gathering flocks  Are selves I overlook.   Wisdom, said William James,    Is learning what to overlook.   And I am wise  If that is wisdom.    Yet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves  And the boy takes it to my station wagon,  What I've become  Troubles me even if I shut my eyes.      When I was young and miserable and pretty  And poor, I'd wish  What all girls wish: to have a husband,  A house and children.   Now that I'm old, my wish  Is womanish:  That the boy putting groceries in my car    See me.   It bewilders me he doesn't see me.    For so many years  I was good enough to eat: the world looked at me  And its mouth watered.   How often they have undressed me,  The eyes of strangers!  And, holding their flesh within my flesh, their vile    Imaginings within my imagining,  I too have taken  The chance of life.   Now the boy pats my dog  And we start home.   Now I am good.    The last mistaken,  Ecstatic, accidental bliss, the blind    Happiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm  Some soap and water--  It was so long ago, back in some Gay  Twenties, Nineties, I don't know .   .   .   Today I miss  My lovely daughter  Away at school, my sons away at school,    My husband away at work--I wish for them.    The dog, the maid,  And I go through the sure unvarying days  At home in them.   As I look at my life,  I am afraid  Only that it will change, as I am changing:    I am afraid, this morning, of my face.    It looks at me  From the rear-view mirror, with the eyes I hate,  The smile I hate.   Its plain, lined look  Of gray discovery  Repeats to me: ""You're old.  "" That's all, I'm old.      And yet I'm afraid, as I was at the funeral  I went to yesterday.    My friend's cold made-up face, granite among its flowers,  Her undressed, operated-on, dressed body  Were my face and body.    As I think of her and I hear her telling me    How young I seem; I am exceptional;  I think of all I have.    But really no one is exceptional,  No one has anything, I'm anybody,  I stand beside my grave  Confused with my life, that is commonplace and solitary."
"When the swans turned my sister into a swan   I would go to the lake, at night, from milking:  The sun would look out through the reeds like a swan,   A swan's red beak; and the beak would open  And inside there was darkness, the stars and the moon.      Out on the lake, a girl would laugh.     ""Sister, here is your porridge, sister,""  I would call; and the reeds would whisper,   ""Go to sleep, go to sleep, little swan.  ""  My legs were all hard and webbed, and the silky    Hairs of my wings sank away like stars   In the ripples that ran in and out of the reeds:  I heard through the lap and hiss of water   Someone's ""Sister .   .   .   sister,"" far away on the shore,  And then as I opened my beak to answer    I heard my harsh laugh go out to the shore   And saw - saw at last, swimming up from the green  Low mounds of the lake, the white stone swans:   The white, named swans .   .   .   ""It is all a dream,""  I whispered, and reached from the down of the pallet    To the lap and hiss of the floor.     And ""Sleep, little sister,"" the swan all sang  From the moon and stars and frogs of the floor.     But the swan my sister called, ""Sleep at last, little sister,""  And stroked all night, with a black wing, my wings."
"The moon rises.   The red cubs rolling  In the ferns by the rotten oak  Stare over a marsh and a meadow  To the farm's white wisp of smoke.    A spark burns, high in heaven.    Deer thread the blossoming rows  Of the old orchard, rabbits  Hop by the well-curb.   The cock crows  From the tree by the widow's walk;  Two stars in the trees to the west,  Are snared, and an owl's soft cry  Runs like a breath through the forest.    Here too, though death is hushed, though joy  Obscures, like night, their wars,  The beings of this world are swept  By the Strife that moves the stars.  "
"From my mother's sleep I fell into the State,  And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.    Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,  I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.    When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose."
" Looking back in my mind I can see   The white sun like a tin plate   Over the wooden turning of the weeds;   The street jerking --a wet swing--   To end by the wall the children sang.       The thin grass by the girls' door,   Trodden on, straggling, yellow and rotten,   And the gaunt field with its one tied cow--   The dead land waking sadly to my life--   Stir, and curl deeper in the eyes of time.       The rotting pumpkin under the stairs   Bundled with switches and the cold ashes   Still holds for me, in its unwavering eyes,   The stinking shapes of cranes and witches,   Their path slanting down the pumpkin's sky.       Its stars beckon through the frost like cottages   (Homes of the Bear, the Hunter--of that absent star,   The dark where the flushed child struggles into sleep)   Till, leaning a lifetime to the comforter,   I float above the small limbs like their dream:     I, I, the future that mends everything."
" At the back of the houses there is the wood.    While there is a leaf of summer left, the wood    Makes sounds I can put somewhere in my song,  Has paths I can walk, when I wake, to good    Or evil: to the cage, to the oven, to the House  In the Wood.   It is a part of life, or of the story    We make of life.   But after the last leaf,  The last light--for each year is leafless,    Each day lightless, at the last--the wood begins  Its serious existence: it has no path,    No house, no story; it resists comparison.  .  .    One clear, repeated, lapping gurgle, like a spoon    Or a glass breathing, is the brook,  The wood's fouled midnight water.   If I walk into the wood    As far as I can walk, I come to my own door,  The door of the House in the Wood.   It opens silently:    On the bed is something covered, something humped  Asleep there, awake there--but what? I do not know.      I look, I lie there, and yet I do not know.    How far out my great echoing clumsy limbs    Stretch, surrounded only by space! For time has struck,  All the clocks are stuck now, for how many lives,    On the same second.   Numbed, wooden, motionless,  We are far under the surface of the night.      Nothing comes down so deep but sound: a car, freight cars,  A high soft droning, drawn out like a wire    Forever and ever--is this the sound that Bunyan heard  So that he thought his bowels would burst within him?--    Drift on, on, into nothing.   Then someone screams  A scream like an old knife sharpened into nothing.      It is only a nightmare.   No one wakes up, nothing happens,  Except there is gooseflesh over my whole body--    And that too, after a little while, is gone.    I lie here like a cut-off limb, the stump the limb has left.  .  .      Here at the bottom of the world, what was before the world  And will be after, holds me to its back    Breasts and rocks me: the oven is cold, the cage is empty,  In the House in the Wood, the witch and her child sleep.  "
"isagree.   When someone suffers, no one else eats   Or walks or opens the window--no one breathes   As the sufferers watch the sufferer.     In St.   Sebastian Mourned by St.   Irene  The flame of one torch is the only light.     All the eyes except the maidservant's (she weeps   And covers them with a cloth) are fixed on the shaft   Set in his chest like a column; St.   Irene's   Hands are spread in the gesture of the Madonna,   Revealing, accepting, what she does not understand.     Her hands say: ""Lo! Behold!""   Beside her a monk's hooded head is bowed, his hands   Are put together in the work of mourning.     It is as if they were still looking at the lance   Piercing the side of Christ, nailed on his cross.     The same nails pierce all their hands and feet, the same   Thin blood, mixed with water, trickles from their sides.     The taste of vinegar is on every tongue   That gasps, ""My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?""  They watch, they are, the one thing in the world.       So, earlier, everything is pointed   In van der Goes' Nativity, toward the naked   Shining baby, like the needle of a compass.     The different orders and sizes of the world:   The angels like Little People, perched in the rafters   Or hovering in mid-air like hummingbirds;   The shepherds, so big and crude, so plainly adoring;   The medium-sized donor, his little family,   And their big patron saints; the Virgin who kneels   Before her child in worship; the Magi out in the hills   With their camels--they ask directions, and have pointed out   By a man kneeling, the true way; the ox   And the donkey, two heads in the manger   So much greater than a human head, who also adore;   Even the offerings, a sheaf of wheat,   A jar and a glass of flowers, are absolutely still   In natural concentration, as they take their part   In the salvation of the natural world.     The time of the world concentrates   On this one instant: far off in the rocks   You can see Mary and Joseph and their donkey   Coming to Bethlehem; on the grassy hillside   Where their flocks are grazing, the shepherds gesticulate   In wonder at the star; and so many hundreds   Of years in the future, the donor, his wife,   And their children are kneeling, looking: everything   That was or will be in the world is fixed   On its small, helpless, human center.       After a while the masters show the crucifixion   In one corner of the canvas: the men come to see   What is important, see that it is not important.     The new masters paint a subject as they please,   And Veronese is prosecuted by the Inquisition   For the dogs playing at the feet of Christ,   The earth is a planet among galaxies.     Later Christ disappears, the dogs disappear: in abstract   Understanding, without adoration, the last master puts   Colors on canvas, a picture of the universe   In which a bright spot somewhere in the corner   Is the small radioactive planet men called Earth.  "
"He went up under the gray leaves  All gray and lost in the olive lands  And laid his forehead, gray with dust,  Deep in the dustiness of his hot hands.    After everything this.   And this was the end.    -- Now I must go, as I am going blind.    And why is it Thy will that I must say  Thou art, when I myself no more can find Thee.    I find Thee no more.   Not in me, no.    Not in others.   Not in this stone,  I find Thee no more.   I am alone.    I am alone with all men's sorrow --  All that, through Thee, I thought to lighten,  Thou who art not, O nameless shame .  .  .    Men said, later: an angel came.    Why an angel? Alas, there came the night,  And leafed through the trees, indifferently.    The disciples moved a little in their dreams.    Why an angel? Alas, there came the night.    The night that came was no uncommon night:  So hundreds of nights go by.    There dogs sleep; there stones lie,  Alas a sorrowful, alas any night  That waits till once more it is morning.    For then beseech: the angels do not come,  Never do nights grow great around them.    Who lose themselves, all things let go;  They are renounced by their own fathers  And shut from their own mothers' hearts."
" One looks from the train  Almost as one looked as a child.   In the sunlight  What I see still seems to me plain,  I am safe; but at evening  As the lands darken, a questioning  Precariousness comes over everything.    Once after a day of rain  I lay longing to be cold; after a while  I was cold again, and hunched shivering  Under the quilt's many colors, gray  With the dull ending of the winter day,  Outside me there were a few shapes  Of chairs and tables, things from a primer;  Outside the window  There were the chairs and tables of the world .  .  .    I saw that the world  That had seemed to me the plain  Gray mask of all that was strange  Behind it -- of all that was -- was all.    But it is beyond belief.    One thinks, ""Behind everything  An unforced joy, an unwilling  Sadness (a willing sadness, a forced joy)  Moves changelessly""; one looks from the train  And there is something, the same thing  Behind everything: all these little villages,  A passing woman, a field of grain,  The man who says good-bye to his wife --  A path through a wood all full of lives, and the train  Passing, after all unchangeable  And not now ever to stop, like a heart --  It is like any other work of art,  It is and never can be changed.    Behind everything there is always  The unknown unwanted life."
" I ate pancakes one night in a Pancake House  Run by a lady my age.   She was gay.    When I told her that I came from Pasadena  She laughed and said, ""I lived in Pasadena  When Fatty Arbuckle drove the El Molino bus.  ""    I felt that I had met someone from home.    No, not Pasadena, Fatty Arbuckle.    Who's that? Oh, something that we had in common  Like -- like -- the false armistice.   Piano rolls.    She told me her house was the first Pancake House    East of the Mississippi, and I showed her  A picture of my grandson.   Going home --  Home to the hotel -- I began to hum,  ""Smile a while, I bid you sad adieu,  When the clouds roll back I'll come to you.  ""    Let's brush our hair before we go to bed,  I say to the old friend who lives in my mirror.    I remember how I'd brush my mother's hair  Before she bobbed it.   How long has it been  Since I hit my funnybone? had a scab on my knee?    Here are Mother and Father in a photograph,  Father's holding me.  .  .  .   They both look so young.    I'm so much older than they are.   Look at them,  Two babies with their baby.   I don't blame you,  You weren't old enough to know any better;    If I could I'd go back, sit down by you both,  And sign our true armistice: you weren't to blame.    I shut my eyes and there's our living room.    The piano's playing something by Chopin,  And Mother and Father and their little girl    Listen.   Look, the keys go down by themselves!  I go over, hold my hands out, play I play --  If only, somehow, I had learned to live!  The three of us sit watching, as my waltz  Plays itself out a half-inch from my fingers."
In the shabby train no seat is vacant.    The child in the ripped mask  Sprawls undisturbed in the waste  Of the smashed compartment.   Is their calm extravagant?  They had faces and lives like you.   What was it they possessed  That they were willing to trade for this?  The dried blood sparkles along the mask  Of the child who yesterday possessed  A country welcomer than this.    Did he? All night into the waste  The train moves silently.   The faces are vacant.    Have none of them found the cost extravagant?  How could they? They gave what they possessed.    Here all the purses are vacant.    And what else could satisfy the extravagant  Tears and wish of the child but this?  Impose its canceling terrible mask  On the days and faces and lives they waste?  What else are their lives but a journey to the vacant  Satisfaction of death? And the mask  They wear tonight through their waste  Is death's rehearsal.   Is it really extravagant  To read in their faces: What is there we possessed  That we were unwilling to trade for this?
"The saris go by me from the embassies.      Cloth from the moon.   Cloth from another planet.     They look back at the leopard like the leopard.      And I.   .   .   .     this print of mine, that has kept its color  Alive through so many cleanings; this dull null  Navy I wear to work, and wear from work, and so  To my bed, so to my grave, with no  Complaints, no comment: neither from my chief,  The Deputy Chief Assistant, nor his chief--  Only I complain.   .   .   .   this serviceable  Body that no sunlight dyes, no hand suffuses  But, dome-shadowed, withering among columns,  Wavy beneath fountains--small, far-off, shining  In the eyes of animals, these beings trapped  As I am trapped but not, themselves, the trap,  Aging, but without knowledge of their age,  Kept safe here, knowing not of death, for death--  Oh, bars of my own body, open, open!    The world goes by my cage and never sees me.    And there come not to me, as come to these,  The wild beasts, sparrows pecking the llamas' grain,  Pigeons settling on the bears' bread, buzzards  Tearing the meat the flies have clouded.   .   .   .     Vulture,  When you come for the white rat that the foxes left,   Take off the red helmet of your head, the black  Wings that have shadowed me, and step to me as man:  The wild brother at whose feet the white wolves fawn,  To whose hand of power the great lioness  Stalks, purring.   .   .   .     You know what I was,  You see what I am: change me, change me!  "
"What a girl called ""the dailiness of life""  (Adding an errand to your errand.   Saying,  ""Since you're up .   .   .  "" Making you a means to  A means to a means to) is well water  Pumped from an old well at the bottom of the world.    The pump you pump the water from is rusty  And hard to move and absurd, a squirrel-wheel  A sick squirrel turns slowly, through the sunny  Inexorable hours.   And yet sometimes  The wheel turns of its own weight, the rusty  Pump pumps over your sweating face the clear  Water, cold, so cold! you cup your hands  And gulp from them the dailiness of life.  "
"You have passed, as they say, into worlds elsewhere.  Emptiness...  Fly, cutting your way into starry dubiety.  No advances, no pubs for you there.  Sobriety.  No, Yessenin, this is not deridingly,-  in my throat not laughter but sorrow racks.  I see - your cut-open hand maddeningly,  swings your own bones like a sack.  Stop it, chuck it! Isn't it really absurd?  Allowing cheeks to flush with deathly hue?  You who could do such things with words,  that no one else on earth could do.  Why, for what? Perplexity appalls.  Critics mutter: ""The main fault we find  there was hardly any working-class contact at all,  as a result of too much beer and wine.""  So to say, if you had swopped bohemianism for class,  there'd have been no bust-up,                                class'd have influenced                                                            your thinking.  But does class quench its thirst with kvass?  Class, too, is no fool when it comes to drinking.  They'd have attached to you someone from On Guard,  and the main accent would have been on content:  a hundred lines a day you'd have written hard,  as tedious and long-winded as Doronin's attempts.  Before I'd created such nonsensical stink,  I'd have choked my very own breath.  Better far to die of drink,  than be bored to death!  Neither the noose nor the penknife there  will reveal the true cause of this loss. But,  maybe, if there had been ink in the Angleterre,  there'd have been no reason for veins to be cut.  ""Encore!"" imitators coo in delight.  Over you almost a squad committed base jinks.  Why increase the number of suicides?  Better to increase the output of ink!  It's grievous and misplaced to be mystery-propagators.  For ever now your tongue by teeth's locked tight.  Of the people, the language-creators,  a sonorous apprentice-debauchee has died.  And, as condolences, poetic junk they gave,  unrehashed hangovers from funerals of the past.  Blunted rhymes are shoved in to exorcise your grave-  is that how a poet is honoured at the last?  A monument for you hasn't yet been cast-  where it is, bronze reverberant or granite grand? -  but there, already, by memory's bars  dedications and memoirs of rubbish stand.  Your name into handkerchiefs they're sniveling,  your words by Sobinov are slobberingly lisped there-  and they wind up under a dead birch tree quivering:  ""Not a word, O my friend, not a whisper,""  Eh, to a quite a different tune I'd switch  and just tell that Leonid Lohengrinich!  I'd rise up here a thundering scadalist:  ""I won't allow poems to be mangled by mutts!  I'd deafen them with a double-barreled whistle.  They can stick 'em where the monkey stuck his nuts!""  And so disperse such talentless filth,  blowing away jacket-sails engendered darkness,  so that helter-skelter runs Kogan and his ilk,  mutilating oncomers with the spears of his moustaches.  The ranks of rubbish meanwhile haven't grown much thinner.  There's so much to do - just to catch up with things yet.  Life must be changed to begin with.  And having changed it - then one can sing it.  These days are difficult for the pen.  But tell me, you crooks and cripples wheezy,  which great ones ever choose- where and when?  a path already trodden smooth and easy?  The word - in the C-in-C of human powers.  Forward march! That time may whistle by as rockets flare.  So the wind shall carry to the past of ours  only the ruffling of our hair.  Our planet is poorly equipped for delight.  One must snatch gladness from the days that are.  In this life                it's not difficult to die.  To make life                    is more difficult by far."
"Six.  Ponderous. The chimes of a clock.  ""Render unto Caesar ... render unto God...""  But where’s  someone like me to dock?  Where’11 I find a lair?    Were I  like the ocean of oceans little,  on the tiptoes of waves I’d rise,  I’d strain, a tide, to caress the moon.  Where to find someone to love  of my size,  the sky too small for her to fit in?    Were I poor  as a multimillionaire,  it’d still be tough.  What’s money for the soul? -  thief insatiable.  The gold  of all the Californias isn’t enough  for my desires’ riotous horde.    I wish I were tongue-tied,  like Dante or Petrarch,  able to fire a woman’s heart,  reduce it to ashes with verse-filled pages!  My words  and my love  form a triumphal arch:  through it, in all their splendour,  leaving no trace, will pass  the inamoratas of all the ages!    Were I  as quiet as thunder,  how I’d wail and whine!  One groan of mine  would start the world’s crumbling cloister shivering.  And if  I’d end up by roaring  with all of its power of lungs and more -  the comets, distressed, would wring their hands  and from the sky’s roof  leap in a fever.    If I were dim as the sun,  night I’d drill  with the rays of my eyes,  and also  all by my lonesome,  radiant self  build up the earth’s shriveled bosom.    On I’ll pass,  dragging my huge love behind me.  On what  feverish night, deliria-ridden,  by what Goliaths was I begot -  I, so big  and by no one needed?"
I suddenly smeared the weekday map  splashing paint from a glass;  On a plate of aspic  I revealed  the ocean's slanted cheek.  On the scales of a tin fish  I read the summons of new lips.  And you  could you perform  a nocturne on a drainpipe flute?
"Thoughts, go your way home.  Embrace,        depths of the soul and the sea.  In my view,           it is                 stupid  to be         always serene.  My cabin is the worst                     of all cabins  -    All night above me               Thuds a smithy of feet.  All night,               stirring the ceiling’s calm,  dancers stampede                             to a moaning motif:  ""Marquita,                 Marquita,  Marquita my darling,  why won’t you,               Marquita,  why won’t you love me â€¦""  But why              Should marquita love me?!

The sum’s not large  -                                  just live for show  -    No,       you highbrow,                               ruffling your matted hair,  you would thrust upon her                                           a sewing machine,  in stitches                  scribbling                                  the silk of verse.  Proletarians                   arrive at communism                                                     from below  -    by the low way of mines,                                         sickles,                                                      and pitchforks  -    But I,         from poetry’s skies,                                         plunge into communism,  because              without it                              I feel no love.  Whether              I’m self-exiled                                     or sent to mamma  -    the steel of words corrodes,                                             the brass of the brass tarnishes.  Why,         beneath foreign rains,  must I soak,                    rot,                          and rust?  Here I recline,                       having gone oversea,  in my idleness                       barely moving                                              my machine parts.

I object            to being torn up,  like a flower of the fields,                                           after a long day’s work.

I want          a commissar                             with a decree  to lean over the thought of the age.  I want           the heart to earn  its love wage                      at a specialist’s rate.  I want           the factory committee                                               to lock  My lips             when the work is done.

"Over those           whom  sleep eternal claimed  that lean,           harsh winter                       spread                             a pall.  What  are words!                Words                     are lame!  On the Volga sores                   I refuse                           to dwell.  Of a string of days                    I choose                            to speak,  akin     to a thousand others,                          bleak,  pushed on          by the years,                       oarsmen eager,  not over-fat             nor                over-meagre.  If ever        something of worth                          I wrote  it was all          the  fault  of a pair          of eyes-                   bottomless skies,  my  beloved's eyes.  Huge  they are,  round,  dark brown,  with a speck             of hazel,  coal-hot,         blazing.  The  phone's gone                  stark-raving mad,  an axe's         blunt edge                   striking the ear:                                    wham!  Round  the huge brown  eyes -                              pads:  hunger's         to blame.  Doctor's orders:  for the eyes             to be able  to eye        the world,    heat the place,  put greens           on the table.  By their curly green tails -                             behold!-  I'm holding            two  carrots                       crunchy.  They're not            for my  stew:  I'm taking them to  my sweetheart,               for her                      to munch.  Boxes of sweets                and flowers                           freely  I handed  out,               but                  I recall  that those carrots                   plus firewood                  (half a billet)  were     the most precious                      gift                          of all.  Thrust under my arm                    are  damp pieces of wood:                     knobby sticks,               eyebrow-thick.  Face puffy,  eyes-splits:  it's     malnutrition.  Greens and care -                   eyes clear.  Bigger than saucers,                    they eye                            the Revolution.  Easier for me              than for most              (it's no boast!)  Because I'm  Mayakovsky.    I sit and chew  a fresh  piece of horse flesh.  The door whines.  My kid sister.  ""Hullo!""  ""Hullo!""  ""Volodya, listen,  it's New Year's tomorrow.  Got some salt              I could borrow?""  ""A pinch,          Wet  too.  Here,      let's divide it in two.""  Wading  through  snow,                       fighting fear,  with an         ""Oh, dear,                   how'll I keep on my feet!""  Olga  stumbles along  the icy,         three-mile long                        Presnya Street.  Home     to salt her potatoes                         she hastens.  Frost      walks           beside her,  grows fierce,              inches  closer,       tickles              and  pinches.  ""Gimme it!           Isn't that salt                          you're hiding?""  Home at last,              and didn't lose it.  But how  use it?  To  her fingers               it's frozen fast.  Behind  the wall                shuffling feet.  ""Here,  wife,             we gotta eat.  Trade  my  coat               for millet,                         will ye?""  Look  through the pane-  it's snowing again.  The snow  falls,  covering all.  Soft its step,             yes,                and  light.  Moscow's          a cliff,                bare                    and white.  Snow lies          in banks                  and drifts.  Of forests          the skeleton clings                            to the cliff.  Daybreak.          Into the sky's thick shawl  the sun,         a louse,                crawls.  December's late dawn,                      worn out,                               shivery,  hangs      over Moscow                 like typhus fever.  Storm  clouds vagrant  to fat lands migrate.  Wrapped  in haze,  its chest sticking out,                     America  lies.  What  is it doing? -                     Lapping up  coffee       and cocoa                by  the cup.  Into your face,                thick as the snout  of a good-sized pig,           than a round tray rounder,  from  this hungering land of ours                                 I shout:  My love        for my land                   is boundless!    You can forget              when                  and where  you stuffed           your craw                    and your belly,                                   but  the land         you hungered with                          you can never  as long as you live and breathe                                forget!"
"Awhirl with events,                    packed with jobs one too many,  the day slowly sinks                     as the night shadows fall.  There are two in the room:                            I                             and Lenin-  a photograph              on the whiteness of wall.    The stubble slides upward                          above his lip  as his mouth              jerks open in speech.

"I'd tear           like a wolf              at bureaucracy.  For mandates           my respect's but the slightest.

They take           with respect, for instance,              the passport  From a sleeping-car  English Lionel.  The good fellows eyes           almost slip like pips  when,           bowing as low as men can,  they take,           as if they were taking a tip,  the passport           from an American.  At the Polish,           they dolefully blink and wheeze  in dumb           police elephantism -  where are they from,           and what are these  geographical novelties?  And without a turn           of their cabbage heads,  their feelings           hidden in lower regions,  they take without blinking,           the passports from Swedes  and various           old Norwegians.

And, possibly, your scholars                                             will declare,  with their erudition overwhelming                                                       a swarm of problems;  once there lived                          a certain champion of boiled water,  and inveterate enemy of raw water.    Professor,               take off your bicycle glasses!  I myself will expound                                   those times                                                     and myself.    I, a latrine cleaner                            and water carrier,  by the revolution                           mobilized and drafted,  went off to the front                                from the aristocratic gardens  of poetry -                 the capricious wench  She planted a delicious garden,  the daughter,                   cottage,                             pond                                    and meadow.

There’s no damming al this up -  beneath the walls they mandoline:  ""Tara-tina, tara-tine,  tw-a-n-g...""  It’s no great honor, then,                                        for my monuments  to rise from such roses  above the public squares,                                        where consumption coughs,  where whores, hooligans and syphilis                                                            walk.    Agitprop               sticks                       in my teeth too,  and I’d rather                     compose                                 romances for you -  more profit in it                          and more charm.    But I         subdued                     myself,                              setting my heel  on the throat                   of my own song.  Listen,         comrades of posterity,  to the agitator                     the rabble-rouser.    Stifling           the torrents of poetry,  I’ll skip           the volumes of lyrics;  as one alive,                  I’ll address the living.  I’ll join you                   in the far communist future,  I who am             no Esenin super-hero.    My verse will reach you                                      across the peaks of ages,  over the heads                      of governments and poets.    My verse             will reach you  not as an arrow                        in a cupid-lyred chase,  not as worn penny  Reaches a numismatist,  not as the light of dead stars reaches you.    My verse              by labor                         will break the mountain chain of years,  and will present itself                                  ponderous,                                                 crude,                                                        tangible,  as an aqueduct,                       by slaves of Rome  constructed,                  enters into our days.    When in mounds of books,                                         where verse lies buried,  you discover by chance the iron filings of lines,  touch them                 with respect,                                   as you would  some antique                    yet awesome weapon.    It’s no habit of mine                               to caress                                           the ear                                                    with words;  a maiden’s ear                       curly-ringed  will not crimson                         when flicked by smut.    In parade deploying                               the armies of my pages,  I shall inspect                      the regiments in line.    Heavy as lead,                     my verses at attention stand,  ready for death                       and for immortal fame.    The poems are rigid,                                pressing muzzle  to muzzle their gaping                                   pointed titles.    The favorite                  of all the armed forces  the cavalry of witticisms                                       ready  to launch a wild hallooing charge,  reins its chargers still,                                 raising  the pointed lances of the rhymes.  and all           these troops armed to the teeth,  which have flashed by                                   victoriously for twenty years,  all these,             to their very last page,  I present to you,                         the planet’s proletarian.    The enemy                of the massed working class  is my enemy too                          inveterate and of long standing.    Years of trial                     and days of hunger                                                  ordered us  to march             under the red flag.    We opened                 each volume                                   of Marx  as we would open                            the shutters                                             in our own house;  but we did not have to read                                           to make up our minds  which side to join,                            which side to fight on.    Our dialectics                     were not learned                                              from Hegel.  In the roar of battle                              it erupted into verse,  when,         under fire,                       the bourgeois decamped  as once we ourselves                                 had fled                                             from them.  Let fame              trudge                      after genius  like an inconsolable widow                                          to a funeral march -  die then, my verse,                            die like a common soldier,  like our men                   who nameless died attacking!  I don’t care a spit                           for tons of bronze;  I don’t care a spit                            for slimy marble.  We’re men of  kind,                              we’ll come to terms about our fame;  let our          common monument be  socialism               built                     in battle.  Men of posterity                          examine the flotsam of dictionaries:  out of Lethe                  will bob up                                  the debris of such words  as ""prostitution,""                        ""tuberculosis,""                                          ""blockade.""  For you,           who are now                             healthy and agile,  the poet            with the rough tongue                                             of his posters,  has licked away consumptives’ spittle.  With the tail of my years behind me,                                                          I begin to resemble  those monsters,                       excavated dinosaurs.  Comrade life,                     let us                            march faster,  march          faster through what’s left                                                 of the five-year plan.  My verse              has brought me                                    no rubles to spare:  no craftsmen have made                                     mahogany chairs for my house.  In all conscience,                           I need nothing  except          a freshly laundered shirt.  When I appear                       before the CCC                                              of the coming                                              bright years,  by way of my Bolshevik party card,                                                        I’ll raise  above the heads                        of a gang of self-seeking                                                             poets and rogues,  all the hundred volumes                                     of my                                             communist-committed books."
"Past one o’clock. You must have gone to bed.  The Milky Way streams silver through the night.  I’m in no hurry; with lightning telegrams  I have no cause to wake or trouble you.  And, as they say, the incident is closed.  Love’s boat has smashed against the daily grind.  Now you and I are quits. Why bother then  To balance mutual sorrows, pains, and hurts.  Behold what quiet settles on the world.  Night wraps the sky in tribute from the stars.  In hours like these, one rises to address  The ages, history, and all creation."
"Tobacco smoke has consumed the air.  The room  is a chapter in Kruchenykh's inferno.  Remember -  beyond that window  in a frenzy  I first stroked your hands.  You sit here today  with an iron-clad heart.  Oone more day  you'll toss me out,  perhaps, cursing.  In the dim front hall my arm,  broken by trembling won't fit right away in my sleeve.  I'll run out,  throw my body into the street.  I'll rave,  wild,  lashed by despair.  Don't let it happen  my dear,  my darling,  let us part now.  After all  my love  is a heavy weight  hanging on you  no matter where you go.  Let me bellow a final cry  of bitter, wounded grievance.  If you drive a bull to exhaustion  he will run away,  lay himself down in the cold waters.  Besides your love  I have  no ocean  and your love won't grant even a tearful plea for rest.  When a tired elephant wants peace  he lies down regally in the firebound sand.  Besides your love  I have  no sun,  but I don't even know where you are and with whom.  If you tortured a poet like this,  he  would berate his beloved for money and fame,  but for me  no sound is joyous  but the sound of your beloved name.  I won't throw myself downstairs  or drink poison  nor can I put a gun to my head.  No blade  holds me transfixed  but your glance.  Tomorrow you'll forget  that I have crowned you,  that I burned my flowering soul with love,  and the whirling carnival of trivial days  will ruffle the pages of my books...  Would the dry leaves of my words  force you to a stop  gasping for air?    At least let me  pave with a parting endearment  your retreating path."
"A hundred suns the sunset fired,  into July summer shunted,  it was so hot,  even heat perspired-  it happened in the country.  The little hamlet known as Pushkino,  Akula's Mount  made hunchbacked.  Below, the village  seemed pushed-in so --  its crooked roof-crusts cracked.  And beyond that village  yawned a hole,  into that hole- and not just maybe -  the sun for certain always rolled,  slowly, surely, daily.  At morn  to flood the world  again  the sun rose up-  and ruddied it.  Day after day  it happened this way,  till I got  fed up with it.  And one day I let out such a shout,  that everything grew pale,  point-blank at the sun I yelled:  ""Get out!  Enough of loafing there in hell!""  To the sun I yelled:  ""You lazy mummer!  in the clouds cushioning,  while here - knowing neither winter nor summer,  I sit, just posters brushing!""  I yelled to the sun:  ""Hey, wait there!  Listen, golden brightbrow,  instead of vainly  setting in the air,  have tea with me  right now!""  What have I done!  For ruin I'm heading!  To me,  of his own goodwill,  the sun himself,  ray-strides outspreading,  is marching over the hill.  Not wanting to show him I'm afraid-  back I retreat, guardedly.  Now his eyes lighten the garden shade.  He's actually in the garden now.  Through windows,  doors,  crannies he spread;  in flooded a sunny mass,  having burst in  he drew his breath,  and spoke in a deep bass.  ""I've withheld my fires you see  the first time since creation began.  You've invited me?  So lay out the tea,  and, poet, lay on the jam!""  Tears from my poor eyes were streaming-  the heat really made me scary,  all the same-  I got the samovar steaming:  ""Of course,  sit down, comrade luminary!""  What possessed me to shout at him like a fool,  inwardly myself I cursed, -  and sat confused  on the corner of a stool,  frightened it might be worse!  But a radiance strange  streamed from the sun, -  and my tact  no longer taxing,  I sit and chat with the luminated one,  gradually relaxing.  About this,  and about that I chatted,  worn out with ROSTA publicity,  but the sun:  ""Alright,  don't get so rattled,  see things with greater simplicity!  You think it's easy  for me  to shine so?  - If so, come and have a test! -  But once you go -  why have a go  go - and shine your damnedest!""  We gossiped like that till darkness appeared,  till the night before, that is.  For how could there be any darkness here?  And now  like chums we chatted.  And soon,  in open friendship bonded,  to slap him on the back I dared.  And likewise the sun  warmly responded:  ""Why, comrade, we're a pair!  Come, poet,  let us dawn  and sing  away the drabness of the universe.  As the sun, myself I'll fling,  and you - yourself,  in verse.""  And shadows' walls,  and jails of night  fell to its double-barreled shot.  Battering barrage of poetry and light -  shine out, no matter what!  And when the sun gets tired,  and night  wants to rest  its sleepy-headed,  why suddenly -  I shine with all my might -  and once more day is trumpeted.  Shine all the time,  for ever shine.  the last days' depths to plumb,  to shine - !  spite every hell combined!  So runs my slogan -  and the sun's!"
"I will sew myself black trousers  from the velvet of my voice.  And from three yards of sunset, a yellow blouse.  Along the world's main street, along its glossy lanes,  I will saunter with the gait of Don Juan, a fop.    Let the earth, overripe and placid, cry out:  ""You would rape the green Spring!""  I'll yell at the sun with an impudent grin  ""I prefer to prance on smooth                                                    asphalt!""    Isn't it because the sky is blue,  And the earth is my lover in this spring                                                  cleaning,  that I give you verses fun as bi-bah-boh  and sharp and useful as toothpicks!    Women who love my flesh, and you,  girl, looking at me like a brother,  toss your smiles to me, the poet -  and I'll sew them like flowers onto my fop's blouse!"
"  This body won't start again. Touching his eye sockets  one feels a heap of earth is more alive,  that the earth, even at dawn, does not keep itself so quiet.  But a corpse is the remains of too many awakenings.    We only have this power: to start  each day of life - before the earth,  under a silent sky - waiting for an awakening.  One is amazed by so much drudgery at dawn;  through awakening within awakening a job is done.  But we live only to shudder  at the labor ahead and to awaken the earth one time.  It happens at times. Then it quiets down along with us.    If touching that face the hand would not shake -   if the live hand would feel alive touching it -   if it's true that that cold is only the cold  of the earth, frozen at dawn,  perhaps it'd be an awakening, and things that keep quiet  under the dawn, would speak up again. But my hand  trembles, and of all things resembles a hand  that doesn't move.    At other times waking up at dawn  was a dry pain, a tear of light,  even a deliverance. The stingy word  of the earth was cheerful, for a brief moment,  and to die was to go back there again. Now, the waiting body  is what remains of too many awakenings and doesn't return to the earth.  They don't even say it, the hardened lips."
"Death will come with your eyes -   this death that accompanies us  from morning till night, sleepless,  deaf, like an old regret  or a stupid vice. Your eyes  will be a useless word,  a muted cry, a silence.  As you see them each morning  when alone you lean over  the mirror. O cherished hope,  that day we too shall know  that you are life and nothing.    For everyone death has a look.  Death will come with your eyes.  It will be like terminating a vice,  as seen in the mirror  a dead face re-emerging,  like listening to closed lips.  We'll go down the abyss in silence."
"Why be ashamed? When one has done time,  if they let one out, it's because like everybody else  who belongs to the streets, one has been in prison.    From morning till evening we wander the avenues  whether it's raining or a beautiful sun's showing its face.  It's a joy to meet on the avenues people who talk  and talking among ourselves, bump into girls.  It's a joy to wait and whistle at girls from doorways,  hug them on the streets and take them to movies  and smoking in secret, lean on their beautiful knees.  It's a joy to talk and finger them laughing,  and at night in bed, feeling flung on one's neck  their two arms pulling you down, thinking of morning  when one is released from prison in the fresh sunlight.    From morning till evening wandering drunk  and watching laughing passersby enjoying everybody   - even ugly people - just to feel themselves on the streets.  From morning till evening singing drunkenly  and meeting drunkards and starting discussions  that last a long time and make us thirsty.  All these characters who go talking among themselves,  we want them with us at night, down in the trough,  and to hound them with our guitar  that skips drunkenly and cannot stay confined  but throws the doors wide open to echo in the air -   outside water or stars may rain down. It doesn't matter  if on the avenues at this hour no beautiful girls are strolling:  among us is one who laughs to himself  because he has also been released from prison tonight,  and with him, raising a ruckus and singing, we'll make it to morning."
"You have a face of carved stone,  blood of hardened earth,  you came from the sea.  All is gathered and scrutinized  and rejected by you  like the sea. In your heart  there's silence and words  ingested. You're darkness.  For you, dawn is silence.    You're like the voices  of the earth - the splash  of a pail in a well,  the song of the fire,  the thud of an apple,  resigned words  and thumps on thresholds,  the cry of a boy - things  that never go away.  You're not mute. You're darkness.    You're the closed cellar,  of beaten earth,  where once entered  a barefoot boy  will always remember.  You're the dark room  he'll always remember,  like the antique courtyard  where the dawn revealed itself."
"Man and woman watch each other lying in bed:  their two bodies stretched out wide and exhausted.  the man is still, only the woman takes long breaths  that quiver her ribs. The legs distended  are bony and knotted in the man's. The whispers  from the sun-covered street are foisted on them.    The air hangs impalpable in the heavy shadow  and freezes the drops of living sweat  on the lips. The gazes from the adjoining heads  are identical, but they no longer find each other's bodies  as when they first embraced. They nearly touch.    The woman's lips move a little, but do not speak.  The breathing that swells the ribs stops  at the longest gaze from the man. The woman  turns her face close to the man's, lips to lips.  But the man's gaze does not change in the shadow.    Heavy and still weigh the eyes within eyes  at the warmth of the breath that revives the sweat,  desolate. The woman does not move her body,  supple and alive. The lips of the man come close  but the still gaze does not change in the shadow."
"Black earth red earth,  you come from the sea,  from the arid green,  where there are ancient  words and bloody toil  and geranium among rocks -   you don't know how much you bring  of toil and words from the sea,  you're rich like a memory,  like the barren countryside,  you hard and sweetest word,  ancient because of the blood  gathered in the eyes;  young, like a fruit  that is a memory and a season -   your breath rests  under the sky of August,  the olives of your look  sweeten the sea,  and you live and live again  without amazement, certain  like the earth, dark  like the earth, a grinder  of seasons and dreams  that reveals itself under the moon  to be so old, just like  the hands of your mother,  the bowl of the brazier."
"Dawn's faint breath  breathes with your mouth  at the ends of empty streets.  Gray light your eyes,  sweet drops of dawn  on dark hills.  Your steps and breath  like the wind of dawn  smother houses.  The city shudders,  Stones exhale -   you are life, an awakening.    Star lost  in the light of dawn,  trill of the breeze,  warmth, breath -   the night is done.    You are light and morning."
"On the asphalt of the avenue the moon makes  a quiet lake and my friend remembers other times.  A spontaneous encounter used to be enough for him  and he was no longer alone. Looking at the moon,  he breathed in the night. But the freshest scent  was of a woman encountered, the brief adventure  on unsure steps. The quiet room  and a fleeting desire to live there forever  filled his heart. Then, under the moon,  he returned with long strides, dazed and satisfied.    At that time he was his own great companion.  He woke in the morning and jumped from bed  finding his own body and his old thoughts.  He liked to go out under the rain  or the sun, he enjoyed watching the streets,  and talking to people spontaneously. He believed  he could always change his metier  up to the last day, each new morning.  After great exertions he sat smoking.  His greatest pleasure was to be alone.    My friend has aged and now wants a house  that he could cherish, and leave at night,  and stop on the avenue to look at the moon,  but find on his return a subdued woman,  a quiet woman, patiently waiting.  My friend has aged and is no longer content with himself.  The passersby are always the same; the rain  and the sun, the same; and morning's a desert.  To exert is no longer worth it. And going out under the moon,  when no one's waiting for him, is no longer worth it."
"Stunned by the world, I reached an age  when I threw punches at air and cried to myself.  Listening to the speech of women and men,  not knowing how to respond, it's not fun.  But this too has passed: I'm not alone anymore,  and if I still don't know how to respond,  I don't need to. Finding myself, I found company.    I learned that before I was born I had lived  in men who were steady and firm, lords of themselves,  and none could respond and all remained calm.  Two brothers-in-law opened a store--our family's  first break. The outsider was serious,  scheming, ruthless, and mean--a woman.  The other one, ours, read novels at work,  which made people talk. When customers came,  they'd hear him say, in one or two words,  that no, there's no sugar, Epsom salts no,  we're all out of that. Later it happened  that this one lent a hand to the other, who'd gone broke.    Thinking of these folks makes me feel stronger  than looking in mirrors and sticking my chest out  or shaping my mouth into a humorless smile.  One of my grandfathers, ages ago,  was being cheated by one of his farmhands,  so he worked the vineyards himself, in the summer,  to make sure it was done right. That's how  I've always lived too, always maintaining  a steady demeanor, and paying in cash.    And women don't count in this family.  I mean that our women stay home  and bring us into the world and say nothing  and count for nothing and we don't remember them.  Each of them adds something new to our blood,  but they kill themselves off in the process, while we,  renewed by them, are the ones to endure.  We're full of vices and horrors and whims--"
"Again the rain will fall  on the sweet pavements,  a light rain  like a breath or a footstep.  Again the breeze and the dawn  will blossom lightly  beneath your footstep  as you reenter.  Among flowers and sills  the cats will know it.    There will be other days.  There will be other voices.  You will smile alone.  The cats will know it.  You will hear antique words,  tired and empty words  like the disused costumes  from yesterday's festivals.    You too will make gestures.  You will respond with words -   face of Spring,  you too will make gestures.    The cats will know it,  face of Spring;  and the light rain,  the hyacinth-color dawn,  that tears the heart of one  who no longer longs for you,  they are the sad smile  you smile alone.  There will be other days,  other voices and awakenings.  We will suffer at dawn,  face of Spring."
"From the door of his house in the gentle sunshine  the old man, disillusioned with everything,  watches the dog and the bitch as they follow instinct.    Flies crawl round his toothless mouth.  His wife died some time ago. She too  like all bitches didn't want to hear it mentioned,  but she had the instinct. The old man would smell it out -  he hadn't yet lost his teeth - night would come,  they'd go to bed. Instinct was fine.    It's fine for dogs having so much freedom,  prowling the streets from dawn to dusk,  eating a little, sleeping a little, mounting bitches a little:  they don't even wait for night. They reason  as they smell and what they smell is good.    The old man remembers how once in the daytime  he had it in a field of wheat.  Who the bitch was he no longer knows, but remembers  the hot sun and the sweat and his wish it would last for ever.  It was like being in bed. If the years could return  he'd like to do it always in a field of wheat.    A woman comes down the street and stops to watch;  the priest passes and turns away. In the public square  you can do anything. Even the woman,  too discreet to turn round for a man, stops.  Only a boy can't stand the game  and pelts them with stones. The old man's angry."
