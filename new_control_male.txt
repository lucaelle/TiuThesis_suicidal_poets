Poem
   You tell me I am wrong.   Who are you, who is anybody to tell me I am wrong?   I am not wrong.       In Syracuse, rock left bare by the viciousness of Greek women,   No doubt you have forgotten the pomegranate trees in flower,   Oh so red, and such a lot of them.       Whereas at Venice,   Abhorrent, green, slippery city   Whose Doges were old, and had ancient eyes,   In the dense foliage of the inner garden   Pomegranates like bright green stone,   And barbed, barbed with a crown.   Oh, crown of spiked green metal   Actually growing!       Now, in Tuscany,   Pomegranates to warm your hands at;   And crowns, kingly, generous, tilting crowns   Over the left eyebrow.       And, if you dare, the fissure!       Do you mean to tell me you will see no fissure?   Do you prefer to look on the plain side?       For all that, the setting suns are open.   The end cracks open with the beginning:   Rosy, tender, glittering within the fissure.       Do you mean to tell me there should be no fissure?   No glittering, compact drops of dawn?   Do you mean it is wrong, the gold-filmed skin, integument,               shown ruptured?       For my part, I prefer my heart to be broken.   It is so lovely, dawn-kaleidoscopic within the crack.                                                                                 San Gervasio in Tuscany       
   Would you like to throw a stone at me?   Here, take all that’s left of my peach.       Blood-red, deep:   Heaven knows how it came to pass.   Somebody’s pound of flesh rendered up.       Wrinkled with secrets   And hard with the intention to keep them.       Why, from silvery peach-bloom,   From that shallow-silvery wine-glass on a short stem   This rolling, dropping, heavy globule?       I am thinking, of course, of the peach before I ate it.       Why so velvety, why so voluptuous heavy?   Why hanging with such inordinate weight?   Why so indented?       Why the groove?   Why the lovely, bivalve roundnesses?   Why the ripple down the sphere?   Why the suggestion of incision?       Why was not my peach round and finished like a billiard ball?   It would have been if man had made it.   Though I’ve eaten it now.       But it wasn’t round and finished like a billiard ball;   And because I say so, you would like to throw something at me.       Here, you can have my peach stone.                                                                                    San Gervasio       
   I love you, rotten,   Delicious rottenness.       I love to suck you out from your skins   So brown and soft and coming suave,   So morbid, as the Italians say.       What a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour   Comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:   Stream within stream.       Something of the same flavour as Syracusan muscat wine   Or vulgar Marsala.       Though even the word Marsala will smack of preciosity   Soon in the pussy-foot West.       What is it?   What is it, in the grape turning raisin,   In the medlar, in the sorb-apple,   Wineskins of brown morbidity,   Autumnal excrementa;   What is it that reminds us of white gods?       Gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,   Strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant   As if with sweat,   And drenched with mystery.       Sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns.   I say, wonderful are the hellish experiences,   Orphic, delicate   Dionysos of the Underworld.       A kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment’s orgasm of rupture,   Then along the damp road alone, till the next turning.   And there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,   A new gasp of further isolation,   A new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves.       Going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,   The fibres of the heart parting one after the other   And yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied   Like a flame blown whiter and whiter   In a deeper and deeper darkness,   Ever more exquisite, distilled in separation.       So, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples   The distilled essence of hell.   The exquisite odour of leave-taking. Jamque vale!   Orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell.       Each soul departing with its own isolation.   Strangest of all strange companions,   And best.       Medlars, sorb-apples   More than sweet   Flux of autumn   Sucked out of your empty bladders   And sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of Marsala   So that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,   Orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell   And the ego sum of Dionysos   The sono io of perfect drunkenness   Intoxication of final loneliness.                                                                                    San Gervasio       
   Who gave us flowers?Heaven? The white God?       Nonsense!   Up out of hell,   From Hades;   Infernal Dis!    Jesus the god of flowers—?   Not he.Or sun-bright Apollo, him so musical?   Him neither.    Who then?Say who.   Say it—and it is Pluto,   Dis   The dark one   Proserpine’s master.    Who contradicts—?       When she broke forth from below,   Flowers came, hell-hounds on her heels.   Dis, the dark, the jealous god, the husband,   Flower-sumptuous-blooded.    Go then, he said.   And in Sicily, on the meadows of Enna,   She thought she had left him;   But opened around her purple anemones,   Caverns,   Little hells of color, caves of darkness,   Hell, risen in pursuit of her; royal, sumptuous   Pit-falls.       All at her feet   Hell opening;   At her white ankles   Hell rearing its husband-splendid, serpent heads,   Hell-purple, to get at her—Why did he let her go?   So he could track her down again, white victim.       Ah mastery!   Hell’s husband-blossoms   Out on earth again.       Look out, Persephone!   You, Madame Ceres, mind yourself, the enemy is upon you.   About your feet spontaneous aconite,   Hell-glamorous, and purple husband-tyranny   Enveloping your late-enfranchised plains.       You thought your daughter had escaped?   No more stockings to darn for the flower-roots, down in hell?   But ah my dear!       Aha, the stripe-cheeked whelps, whippet-slim crocuses,At ’em, boys, at ’em!Ho golden-spaniel, sweet alert narcissus,Smell ’em, smell ’em out!   Those two enfranchised women.       Somebody is coming!Oho there!       Dark blue anemones!   Hell is up!   Hell on earth, and Dis within the depths!    Run, Persephone, he is after you already.    Why did he let her go?   To track her down;   All the sport of summer and spring, and flowers snapping                  at her ankles and catching her by the hair!   Poor Persephone and her rights for women.    Husband-snared hell-queen,It is spring.       It is spring,   And pomp of husband-strategy on earth.    Ceres, kiss your girl, you think you’ve got her back.The bit of husband-tilth she is,Persephone!       Poor mothers-in-law!   They are always sold.       It is spring.                                                                                                            Taormina       
   When he pushed his bush of black hair off his brow:   When she lifted her mop from her eyes, and screwed it               in a knob behind               —O act of fearful temerity!   When they felt their foreheads bare, naked to heaven,               their eyes revealed:   When they left the light of heaven brandished like a knife at               their defenceless eyes   And the sea like a blade at their face,   Mediterranean savages:   When they came out, face-revealed, under heaven, from               the shaggy undergrowth of their own hair   For the first time,   They saw tiny rose cyclamens between their toes, growing   Where the slow toads sat brooding on the past.       Slow toads, and cyclamen leaves   Stickily glistening with eternal shadow   Keeping to earth.   Cyclamen leaves   Toad-filmy, earth-iridescent   Beautiful   Frost-filigreed   Spumed with mud   Snail-nacreous   Low down.       The shaking aspect of the sea   And man’s defenceless bare face   And cyclamens putting their ears back.       Long, pensive, slim-muzzled greyhound buds   Dreamy, not yet present,   Drawn out of earth   At his toes.       Dawn-rose   Sub-delighted, stone engendered   Cyclamens, young cyclamens   Arching   Waking, pricking their ears   Like delicate very-young greyhound bitches   Half-yawning at the open, inexperienced   Vistas of day,   Folding back their soundless petalled ears.       Greyhound bitches   Bending their rosy muzzles pensive down,   And breathing soft, unwilling to wake to the new day   Yet sub-delighted.       Ah Mediterranean morning, when our world began!   Far-off Mediterranean mornings,   Pelasgic faces uncovered   And unbudding cyclamens.       The hare suddenly goes uphill   Laying back her long ears with unwinking bliss.       And up the pallid, sea-blenched Mediterranean stone-slopes   Rose cyclamen, ecstatic fore-runner!   Cyclamens, ruddy-muzzled cyclamens   In little bunches like bunches of wild hares   Muzzles together, ears-aprick       Whispering witchcraft   Like women at a well, the dawn-fountain.       Greece, and the world’s morning   While all the Parthenon marbles still fostered the roots of the cyclamen.   Violets   Pagan, rosy-muzzled violets   Autumnal   Dawn-pink,   Dawn-pale   Among squat toad-leaves sprinkling the unborn   Erechtheion marbles.                                                                                                            Taormina       
   A snake came to my water-trough   On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,   To drink there.       In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree   I came down the steps with my pitcher   And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough               before me.       He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom   And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over               the edge of the stone trough   And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,   And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,   He sipped with his straight mouth,   Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,   Silently.       Someone was before me at my water-trough,   And I, like a second-comer, waiting.       He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,   And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,   And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused                a moment,   And stooped and drank a little more,   Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels               of the earth   On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.       The voice of my education said to me   He must be killed,   For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold               are venomous.       And voices in me said, If you were a man   You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.       But must I confess how I liked him,   How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink               at my water-trough   And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,   Into the burning bowels of this earth?       Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?   Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?   Was it humility, to feel so honoured?   I felt so honoured.       And yet those voices:If you were not afraid, you would kill him!       And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,   But even so, honoured still more   That he should seek my hospitality   From out the dark door of the secret earth.       He drank enough   And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,   And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,   Seeming to lick his lips,   And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,   And slowly turned his head,   And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,   Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round   And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.       And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,   And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,               and entered farther,   A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into               that horrid black hole,   Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing               himself after,   Overcame me now his back was turned.       I looked round, I put down my pitcher,   I picked up a clumsy log   And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.       I think it did not hit him,   But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed               in an undignified haste,   Writhed like lightning, and was gone   Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,   At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.       And immediately I regretted it.   I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!   I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.       And I thought of the albatross,   And I wished he would come back, my snake.       For he seemed to me again like a king,   Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,   Now due to be crowned again.       And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords   Of life.   And I have something to expiate:   A pettiness.                                                                                                            Taormina           
   I know if I find you I will have to leave the earth   and go on out        over the sea marshes and the brant in bays   and over the hills of tall hickory   and over the crater lakes and canyons   and on up through the spheres of diminishing air   past the blackset noctilucent clouds              where one wants to stop and look   way past all the light diffusions and bombardments   up farther than the loss of sight       into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark       And I know if I find you I will have to stay with the earth   inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes   trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest        coelenterates   and praying for a nerve cell   with all the soul of my chemical reactions   and going right on down where the eye sees only traces       You are everywhere partial and entire   You are on the inside of everything and on the outside       I walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum   has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut   and I see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark   chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down   and if I find you I must go out deep into your       far resolutions   and if I find you I must stay here with the separate leaves   
   Honor a going thing, goldfinch, corporation, tree,             morality: any working order,          animate or inanimate: it       has managed directed balance,             the incoming and outgoing energies are working right,          some energy left to the mechanism,       some ash, enough energy held             to maintain the order in repair,          assure further consumption of entropy,       expending energy to strengthen order:             honor the persisting reactor,          the container of change, the moderator: the yellow       bird flashes black wing-bars             in the new-leaving wild cherry bushes by the bay,          startles the hawk with beauty,       flitting to a branch where             flash vanishes into stillness,          hawk addled by the sudden loss of sight:       honor the chemistries, platelets, hemoglobin kinetics,             the light-sensitive iris, the enzymic intricacies          of control,       the gastric transformations, seed             dissolved to acrid liquors, synthesized into          chirp, vitreous humor, knowledge,       blood compulsion, instinct: honor the             unique genes,          molecules that reproduce themselves, divide into       sets, the nucleic grain transmitted             in slow change through ages of rising and falling form,          some cells set aside for the special work, mind       or perception rising into orders of courtship,             territorial rights, mind rising          from the physical chemistries       to guarantee that genes will be exchanged, male             and female met, the satisfactions cloaking a deeper          racial satisfaction:       heat kept by a feathered skin:             the living alembic, body heat maintained (bunsen          burner under the flask)       so the chemistries can proceed, reaction rates             interdependent, self-adjusting, with optimum          efficiency—the vessel firm, the flame       staying: isolated, contained reactions! the precise and             necessary worked out of random, reproducible,          the handiwork redeemed from chance, while the       goldfinch, unconscious of the billion operations             that stay its form, flashes, chirping (not a          great songster) in the bay cherry bushes wild of leaf.   
   The song   sparrow puts all his   saying   into one   repeated song:   what       variations, subtleties   he manages,   to encompass denser   meanings, I’m   too coarse   to catch: it’s       one song, an over-reach   from which   all possibilities,   like filaments,   depend:   killing,       nesting, dying,   sun or cloud,   figure up   and become   song—simple, hard:   removed.   
   It doesn't   matter   to me   if   poems mean   nothing:   there's no   floor   to the   universe   and yet   one   walks the   floor.   
   time will wash   away   so   clean not a   cry   will   be left in   it   
   Praying answers prayer:   in the deep spells   of inquiry and hope,   a self   enabled to rise again   to the compromises   and the shattering caring   forms   
   Taking root in windy sand       is not an easy   way   to go about       finding a place to stay.   A ditchbank or wood's-edge       has firmer ground.   In a loose world though       something can be started—   a root touch water,       a tip break sand—   Mounds from that can rise       on held mounds,   a gesture of building, keeping,       a trapping   into shape.   Firm ground is not available ground.   
   I found a   weed   that had a   mirror in it   and that   mirror   looked in at   a mirror   in   me that   had a   weed in it   
   Coming to Sumer and the tamarisks on the river   I Ezra with unsettling love   rifled the mud and wattle huts   for recent mournings   with gold leaves   and lapis lazuli beads   in the neat braids loosening from the skull       Looking through the wattles to the sun   I said   It has rained some here in this place   unless snow falls heavily in the hills   to do this       The floor was smooth with silt   and river weeds hanging gray   on the bent reeds spoke saying   Everything is even here as you can see       Firing the huts   I abandoned the unprofitable poor   unequal even in the bone       to disrespect       and casual with certainty   watched an eagle wing as I went   to king and priest   
            For John Hollander            Although it’s likely you’re on your ownat this moment in this city of three millionreading the poems of Traherne,and there was no one till you lit your lamp,the kingdom of childhood keeps being foundedin his voice and his seeing,which are a sort of birth. A birth goes onin the dark of a poor family, or a mother alone.Then comes the small bright circle of the faces:lover pores over sleeping loved one, parent over childin their enclosure we name home,a hut in the plain so bare there’s not a tongueof grass to make the wind hiss. Unknownto the world a world exists:trees and streams, birds all the colors of the flowers.So Traherne pours over youhis wild remembrance of the world to come. And wouldeven in the silence of his bookif it were lost and lay unopenedtwo hundred years. Even if he had diedbefore he sang the Eden in his look.   
   My father’s been dead for thirty yearsbut when he appears behind my shoulderoffering advice, or condemnation, or a quiet pridein something I’ve done that isn’t even thistledownor tiny shavings of balsa wood in the eyes of the world—“Albie, grip in the middle and turnwith a steady pressure”—it’s measurable,if not the way the wind is in a sock,or ohms, or net-and-gross, it registers the wayan absence sometimes does, and I listen to himwith a care I never exhibited when he was a presence,alive, in his undershirt, chewing his tiny licorice pelletsand radiating a rough-hewn love. “Negativecapability”—the phrase of course is Keats’s,from his letters, but we make it ours a hundred timesa day. A hundred times we do our own pedestrianversion of early maritime cartography: the known worldstops, and over its edge the fuddled mapmaker writesHere There Be Monsters and then illustrates their non-existing coiled lengths and hell-breathwith a color-splotched vivacity he wouldn’t wasteon inhabited shores. Or: “Don’t thinkof a polar bear!”...the game one playswith a child. But I say with adult certainty thatwhen Eddie’s wife Fiona went back to strippinghe couldn’t stand to be at the club and see, and yetthose empty hours in his mind were populated justas unbearably—and indeed, yes, therewere monsters in that void, and the vigilant bearsof insecurity and jealousy padded hungrily behindhis eyes each night until her return. For Keats,however, the force that emptiness makes kinetic isa positive one, the way that the invisible, unknowable“dark energy” is seminal, a kind of funding agencyor sugar daddy powering the universe in allits spangled beauty and veiled mysteryfrom behind the scenes. Last night, a woozy few of uswere mourning the demise of The Dusty Bookshelf.“Well I tried to support it,” I said, “by stopping in from timeto time.” And B, the king of local kleptobibliomania, withhis nimble touch and expando-capacious overalls, said“I tried to support it by not going in.”   
   The light has traveled unthinkable thousands of miles to be      condensed, recharged, and poured off the white white pages   of an open Bible the country parson holds in front of this couple      in a field, in July, in the sap and the flyswirl of July   in upper Wisconsin, where their vows buzz in a ring in the air   like the flies, and are as sweet as the sap, in these rich and ritual minutes.      Is it sentimental? Oops. And out of that Bible the light continues      to rush as if from a faucet. There will be a piecrust cooling      out of its own few x’ed-out cuts. And will it make us run      for the picklier taste of irony rolled around protectively on our tongues      like a grab of Greek olives? My students and I discuss this      slippery phenomenon. Does “context” matter? Does   “earned” count? If a balled-up fidget of snakes   in the underbrush dies in a freeze is it sentimental? No,      yes, maybe. What if a litter of cocker spaniels? What   if we called them “puppydogs” in the same poem in that same hard,      hammering winter? When my father was buried,   the gray snow in the cemetery was sheet tin. If I said   that? Yes, no, what does “tone” or “history” do   to the Hollywood hack violinists who patiently wait to play      the taut nerves of the closest human body until from that      lush cue alone, the eyes swell moistly, and the griefs   we warehouse daily take advantage of this thinning   of our systems, then the first sloppy gushes begin . . .   Is that “wrong”? Did I tell you the breaths   of the gravediggers puffed out like factorysmoke   as they bent and straightened, bent and straightened,   mechanically? Are wise old (toothless) Black blues singers      sentimental?—“gran’ma”? “country cookin’”? But   they have their validity, don't they, yes? their   sweat-in-the-creases, picking up the lighting   in a fine-lined mesh of what it means to have gone through time      alive a little bit on this planet. Hands shoot up . . . opinions . . .   questions . . . What if the sun wept? the moon? Why, in the face   of those open faces, are we so squeamish? Call out   the crippled girl and her only friend the up-for-sale foal,      and let her tootle her woeful pennywhistle musics.   What if some chichi streetwise junkass from the demimonde   gave forth with the story of orphans forced through howling storm      to the workhouse, letting it swing between the icy-blue      quotation marks of cynicism—then? What if      I wept? What if I simply put the page down,      rocked my head in my own folded elbows, forgot      the rest of it all, and wept? What if I stepped into      the light of that page, a burnished and uncompromising      light, and walked back up to his stone a final time,      just that, no drama, and it was so cold,   and the air was so brittle, metal buckled   out song like a bandsaw, and there, from inside me,      where they’d been lost in shame and sophistry   all these years now, every last one of my childhood’s      heartwormed puppydogs found its natural voice.   
   Fire isn’t allowed, for the sake of the books.   The lean monk-copyist who scribes the books is slate-blue at his fingertips   this steely late-November day in the year 1000. Brother Ambrosio   huffs some perfunctory warmth on his stiffening hands,   then bends again to his goat’s-horn of ink. For every line,   he believes, he’s forgiven a sin. And now he’s at his heavy   uncial letters, and will be for nine hours more,   until a slab of bread and a beet relieve his transcriptual ardor.   What he copies?—psalter, missal, hagiography:   the predetermined and sanctioned community passions   of a religious culture. Nothing like the twentieth century’s   prevalent kneejerk “self-expression.” Nothing like the priest,   excuse me: former priest, and former nun, on daytime talk TV,   who live, she tells us, in a “trinity of love” with the former   creator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-heads. This is,   she insists, the final and jubilant stage of a lifelong “quest   to feel belongingness” initiated thirty years before   by parents skittering cross-country with the military: they   were wholly rootless, and so she grew up “unable to commit.” The following day,   a man confesses to pedophilia because of a lesbian aunt.   A woman says she robbed the Sack-N-Save of $13.42   “because of what they’re dumping in the water supply, it makes me   go all freaky.” Steve was bounced out from The Chicken Shack   “because I’m Scandinavian.” The culture   of blame is so completely exterior in its search for cause,   some days I wake to think I’ll find most people laboring   under the weight of sci-fi-style mind parasites, like fleshy turbans   spewing in, and feeding off, their brain blood. This (by “this”   I mean of course a recognition of the magic of objective correlative   boppin’ about in the spotlight) is, to some length,   understandable: you can’t beat the miniscule carry-along   convenience of a silicon chip invisibly set in something,   BUT for sheer persuasive visual power, that can’t touch   a 1940s generating plant, its giant Alcatrazian shape   against the sky, and the enormous wrestling electrical crackles   snaking its rooftop pylon. In the scriptorium, even   —such an isolated unit of human endeavor, its limited range   of reactions surely is pure—when Brother Ambrosio   nods off, sleepy in his long day’s long eighth hour   of thickly nibbed and careful letters, he knows   it’s imps in league with Satan that keep pulling down his eyelids.   If in scratching his flea-measled thigh he spills   a hand’s-expanse of ink across the vellum page, the fleas   are tiny devils on a guerilla mission from Hell.   And once a devilkin took lodging in his belly, and there   created “rumbling noises like a toad, and which, for hours,   spoiled the concentration of all of the other Brothers.”   We find parchment scraps with appropriate exorcisms:   “Away! you flaming sow, you poisoned udder,   you arse of the arch-fiend, shit-fly, stinking he-goat,   out out out, away, back into thine infernal kitchen,   you bestial puke!” We also find   those charming marginal doodles (sprigs in flower,   unicorns, seemingly every songbird in Creation): such   diminutive external bodies given to the longings of these   cooped-up men. And when they came to drag my friend Jess   screaming to the ward, because he was beating his head   on the lawyer’s steps, it was clear to us all that the chemicals   in his mind had turned against him. It was clear to Jess   that he was being hunted like prey by hounds from the moon.   
            1862: Dante Gabriel Rossetti buried his young wife Elizabeth Rossetti with a sheaf of his unpublished poems.                 . . . and then of course the weeping: some demurely, some   flamboyantly. Those elegiac tears, if shed   enough, will alter a face and the person   behind the face. We all know that erosion   is a mighty thing, and even—for example—   the seemingly permanent, hard-black Mississippi banks   undo and slip south. In a sense, the delta   at New Orleans—the land gone silt, and rebuilt—   is the Mississippi’s second thought. “My pet,   your wiles have altered my earlier obstinacy,   and the vision of you in your luxury stateroom beckons;   I shall join you for your voyage on the Gigantic   —what? oh. Titanic”—is a tragic second thought.   A happy one: when Skyler and I decided to try again   to “save the marriage.” Now we’re lazing in a pour   of Sunday morning light as orangely voluptuous   as marmalade. A simile’s a first thought,   then an equaled next. She slips back into sleep,   and now I’m reading about the night that shady London dandy   Charles Augustus Howell (1869) unshoveled the grave   at Highgate, broke the coffin, and looted her bone breast   of “the book in question, bound in rough gray calf, and with   red edges to the leaves,” on eager orders from Rossetti   —who’d had second thoughts in seven years, desiring   to publish now a volume of his verses (1870, Poems).   Lizzie’s death-stenched pages were saturated   with disinfectant by a medical practitioner “who   is drying them leaf by leaf”—and then they joined the world   of woven radish baskets, bobbered fishing skeins, and god dolls   in their second life as art on a museum wall; a world where   the “conversion pool” saw swimmers step in white robes   from its farther end, reborn to new religion; and the lumbering   land animals said no, and gave up legs, and so their legs rolled up   like stored-away and useless rugs inside them, and they returned   to the waters, and birthed and breached in the waters,   and made the waters their orchestral glory,   and spouted out their great Ionic columns of air and water   in the touch of the changing mind of Earth,   that’s sunlit at times   and at other times darkened.   
            The name of his native country pronounced on a distant shore    could not please the ears of a traveller more than hearing    the words “nitrogen,” “oxidation of iron” and “hygrometer.”    —Alexander von Humboldt, nineteenth-century scientist-explorer             When visiting a distant (and imponderable) shire,   one longs to hear the cry “Hygrometer!   Fresh hygrometer for sale!” Yes, and when the fair   sex sidles close and coyly murmurs “nitrogen”   into a burly masculine ear, I guarantee you: the translation   is very easy. The allurements of a local siren,   whispering the kind of patois a traveler like Lord Byron   favors, never fail to comfort, and to reassure,   evoking pleasant memories of one’s own beloved hygrometer   at home, kept fresh in Cosmoline and camphor   and awaiting one’s rearrival back in his native xenon and nitrogen.   Without these occasional reminiscences, any translation   from nation to nation, tongue to tongue, becomes a translation   difficult to sustain. I think of my grandmother: “We're not hirin’   today” “Go away” “Dumb Jew”—her share   of the language that greeted her here in the land of alien hygrometer   and freedom, where she was only one more funny-skirted for-   eigner yearning to hear a lulling Hungarian nitrogen   hum her to sleep. Eventually, of course, the American nitrogen   sufficed. Her daughter could speak, in free translation,   both uranium and argon; and her granddaughter gigs with Fire ’n   Ice, a skinhead punk-grunge group that performs in sheer   black nighties and clown wigs—she plays mean electric hygrometer   in the first set and then, for a twofer,   (very American, that) plays paper-and-comb. Far   out. She’s so fluent in various World Wide Webbery that nitrogen   in a thousand different inflections is her birthright, and almost any translation,   mind to mind, gender to gender, is second nature. “I earn   my keep, I party, I sleep” is her motto. Though she’s for-   tunate in having a lover who’s CEO at Hygrometer,   Potassium, Klein & Wong: it helps to pay the “hygrometer   man” when he knocks at the door. I won’t say that they fear   this guy exactly, but he’s a major badass nitrogen-   sucking cyberwired ninja-kicking shitheel (or, translation:   call him Sir). It makes one pine for a land where the birds all choir in   sweetly trilling melodies on a flower-scented shore,   and a translation sings all night. Row gen-   tly toward it. The tender forests sigh, and the soft whirr   of the hygrometer promises oxidation of iron.   
   Each morning he’d anoint the room’s four corners   with an arc of piss, and then—until   he was forcibly halted—beat his forehead open   on the eastern wall, the “sunrise wall,”   incanting a doggerel prayer about God   the Flower, God of the Hot Plucked Heart; and   she, if loose in the halls, would join him,   squatting in the center of the room and masturbating   with a stolen bar of soap. This isn’t why   they were sent to the madhouse: this is what   they needed to do once in the madhouse: this   is the only meaningful ritual they could fashion   there, created from the few, make-do   materials available. It isn’t wondrous strange   more than the mega-boozhwah formulaic splendor   of my sister’s wedding ten, eleven years ago:   her opulent bouquet of plastic flowers   (for the wilting pour of wattage at the photo session),   nigglingly arranged to match the real bouquet   she carried down the aisle, bloom per bloom;   the five-foot Taj Mahal of sculpted pastel sherbet;   endless “Fiddler on the Roof”; I’m sorry   now I cranked my academic sneer hauteur in place   all night. I’m sorry I didn’t lose myself   like a drunken bee in a room-sized rose,   in waltzing Auntie Sally to the lush swell   of the band. We need this thing. There’s not one   mineral in Stonehenge that our blood can’t also raise.   One dusk, one vividly contusion-color   dusk, with my fists in my pockets and   a puzzle of fish-rib clouds in the sky, I   stopped at the low-level glow of a basement window   (Hot Good Noodle Shop) and furtively looked in:   a full-grown pig was splayed on the table,   stunned but fitfully twitching, it looked as if   it had grasshoppers under its skin. A man and a woman   slit that body jaw-to-ass with an ornate knife,   and then they both scooped out a tumble   of many dozens of wasps, preserved   by the oils of living pig to a beautiful black and amber   gem-like sheen. I saw it. Did I   see it? From inside this, over their wrists   in the tripes, they carefully removed   the wooden doll of a man and the wooden doll of a woman   maybe two inches tall, a tiny lacquered sun   and matching brass coin of a moon, and then   a child’s-third-grade-version of a house   made out of pallid wax: a square of walls,   a pyramid roof, and a real smoking chimney.   
            Fathers are invariably great nuisances on the stage, and always have to give the hero or heroine a long explanation of what was done before the curtain rose, usually commencing with “It is now nineteen years, my dear child, since ...” etc., etc.    —Charles Dickens             There might be a planet. Before that,   though, there would have been a gas that coalesced   into a planet . . . as, before that, there were dots of flux   and energy that hadn’t yet declared themselves   in concert. There’s always “before”: there's more   each minute, more each person, yes and every one   of its smallest, irreducible subparticles—which I name   the “beforeon”—is exerting force on us   that’s surely time’s own version of gravity: its purpose   is to tug, and to remind us. In the house of second marriages,   it causes the man to do what he and the woman had promised   they never would: one night while she’s asleep, he snoops   her bureau for telltale relics of the mysterious Mr.   Number One. And why, or even what   he hopes to find, he couldn’t clearly say: a letter? photo?   sex toy?—something, some objectified gossip, a fossil   of bygone love. Essentially, we make of our own psyches   a bureau and pay a shrink to snoop; as for the moment   when our neural linkage first began to form,   as for the flavor of the fluids in the womb. . . we’re all   amnesiacs: and our earliest self, just like the universe’s   earliest being, is a “phantom limb” with the faintest   mnemonic of starbursts in an otherwise chill void. I have   a friend D____ L____ (this poem is hers) who, orphaned   as a newborn, is devoted to learning her origin   as doggedly as any cosmologist tracks light to its source, althoughher search (when not pure Internet) is more a matter   of tape-recording the beer-sour stories in sailor bars,   of sifting ashy memories in nursing homes,   one backwards inch of plotline at a time. And yet somebody   else is waking up this morning with the need   to be detached from any history,   to stand here like a person in a play who enters   onstage from a pool of perfect blankness. Then,   of course, he can start over, minute-zero-of-year-zero,   unbesmirched. We could have told him that he’d be this   anguished—sneaking in her drawer, below those folded   pastel lozenges of lingerie, uncovering the one thing   that could ruin them. Now he wants only to float (whodoesn't, sometimes?) in an anti-world: appealing, but   illusory. We can’t unmoor ourselves from linearity,   no more than any one of us can be a human being   unconnected to a genome—and in fact, no more   than Mama-All-of-Time-and-Space-Herself (I mean   the cosmos) can unwrap her vasty body from its own   twelve million years of Big Bang “background radiation”   so it wafts—a tossed off, filmy scarf—far elsewhere.   No; there isn’t any “elsewhere.” When we sleep   or simply deepen into quietude enough, the voices   come—the rhythmic, grave, ancestral murmur,   a woman bearing a ritual clamshell bowl . . .   a man with a done-deal sales contract . . . whispers,   knuckle-rap, cleared throats. . . . Her great-grandfather,   D____ L____ has uncovered, was a lector—a reader they used   to relieve the tedium of the leaf rollers’ shifts   in cigar manufactories. Shakespeare, Dickens,   union tracts, love letters, family diaries . . . . He’s   walking through the tobacco aroma; he’s setting his text   on his easel; and the story—the only story we know,   the story of Before—is recited.   
   The renewal project is doomed: because   its funding board’s vice-president resigned: because   the acids of divorce were eating day-long   at her stomach, at her thoughts: because   her husband was neglecting her, in favor of his daughter,   who was dying: because her husband,   bi and edgy, bore an AIDS sore that was ripe   enough with fear and woe to throw this whole   thick network of connections off its balance   and down a hole of human misery. Haven’t we seen it happen?   —when a crowded room at a party was tilted   perilously askew by the weight of two   wept tears that weren’t as large as a housefly’s wings,   that couldn’t have filled a pistachio shell.   _________   It’s like this: because because because,   Sawyer was drunk when he delivered his opening remarks   onstage at Stardome Planetarium. He   stood below a slide show of “The Emptiness of Outer Space”   —stars and planets, scattered like the scantest   motes of dust in unimaginable void—and was about   to make the leap to what percent of us,   our dearly thumping bodies, is a corresponding emptiness . . .   when one foot met a wire that had strayed   outside the curtain, and a wild arc of hand undid   the podium, which canted off its casters sidelong   into the 3-D galaxy props, and you could say whatever   thimble or pustule or hackle of grief was his,   it had toppled the whole damn universe.   _________   Was she a ghost? Sometimes she thought she was   a ghost, transparent, stealing through the lives of people   untouched and untouching. And so she carried a bucket   of burning coals (we’ll call it that for now) against   her breasts; and then she knew she was alive. And   he. . . ?—was just the rusty foxing that an antique book   exhales into dim air, wasn’t that what he was,   oh it was, yes it was, and so one afternoon he strapped   a meteorite to his back, and now he walks the streets   like anybody else. An ageless tribal saying:If you aren’t given a burden, you must carve your own.    An eye will do, if it’s ill. One word, if it’s cruel.   And don’t be fooled by breath: the throat holds up   some old-time blues the way a hod holds bricks.   _________   But she didn’t die of full-blown AIDS   —Sawyer’s daughter. Even so, her twisted legs and limp   are enough to sometimes send him a little   over the blotto line. Tonight, though, after show time,   he’s just soused enough to wander through the mock-up   stage-set milky ways agog with child-wonder:   all those luminescent islands! all that vacuum!   Look: a planet floats, there’s that much cosmos   all around it. A planet! While we . . . we couldn’t   squint and levitate a half inch, not the guru-most   among us. Well, we could: if the laws of the universe changed.   It’s only the Earth that makes us so heavy.   It’s only our lives that keep our lives   from floating off into the nothing.   
   I went for a walk over the dunes again this morning   to the sea,   then turned right along      the surf                            rounded a naked headland                            and returned      along the inlet shore:   it was muggy sunny, the wind from the sea steady and high,      crisp in the running sand,          some breakthroughs of sun      but after a bit   continuous overcast:   the walk liberating, I was released from forms,      from the perpendiculars,         straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds   of thought   into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends                     of sight:                            I allow myself eddies of meaning:      yield to a direction of significance   running   like a stream through the geography of my work:         you can find   in my sayings                            swerves of action                            like the inlet’s cutting edge:                  there are dunes of motion,   organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance      in the overall wandering of mirroring mind:   but Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events   I cannot draw, the ledger I cannot keep, the accounting   beyond the account:   in nature there are few sharp lines: there are areas of      primrose          more or less dispersed;   disorderly orders of bayberry; between the rows   of dunes,   irregular swamps of reeds,   though not reeds alone, but grass, bayberry, yarrow, all ...   predominantly reeds:   I have reached no conclusions, have erected no boundaries,      shutting out and shutting in, separating inside             from outside: I have             drawn no lines:             as   manifold events of sand   change the dune’s shape that will not be the same shape      tomorrow,   so I am willing to go along, to accept      the becoming   thought, to stake off no beginnings or ends, establish               no walls:   by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek      to undercreek: but there are no lines, though          change in that transition is clear          as any sharpness: but “sharpness” spread out,      allowed to occur over a wider range   than mental lines can keep:   the moon was full last night: today, low tide was low:      black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk   of air   and, earlier, of sun,   waved in and out with the waterline, waterline inexact,      caught always in the event of change:             a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals          and ate   to vomiting: another gull, squawking possession, cracked a crab,      picked out the entrails, swallowed the soft-shelled legs, a ruddy   turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits:   risk is full: every living thing in   siege: the demand is life, to keep life: the small   white blacklegged egret, how beautiful, quietly stalks and spears                  the shallows, darts to shore                               to stab—what? I couldn’t          see against the black mudflats—a frightened          fiddler crab?                  the news to my left over the dunes and   reeds and bayberry clumps was                  fall: thousands of tree swallows                  gathering for flight:                  an order held                  in constant change: a congregation   rich with entropy: nevertheless, separable, noticeable             as one event,                         not chaos: preparations for   flight from winter,   cheet, cheet, cheet, cheet, wings rifling the green clumps,   beaks   at the bayberries       a perception full of wind, flight, curve,       sound:       the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness:   the “field” of action   with moving, incalculable center:   in the smaller view, order tight with shape:   blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed: carapace of crab:   snail shell:               pulsations of order               in the bellies of minnows: orders swallowed,      broken down, transferred through membranes   to strengthen larger orders: but in the large view, no   lines or changeless shapes: the working in and out, together                  and against, of millions of events: this,                            so that I make                            no form of                            formlessness:   orders as summaries, as outcomes of actions override      or in some way result, not predictably (seeing me gain      the top of a dune,   the swallows   could take flight—some other fields of bayberry                  could enter fall               berryless) and there is serenity:               no arranged terror: no forcing of image, plan,   or thought:   no propaganda, no humbling of reality to precept:   terror pervades but is not arranged, all possibilities      of escape open: no route shut, except in         the sudden loss of all routes:               I see narrow orders, limited tightness, but will      not run to that easy victory:               still around the looser, wider forces work:               I will try          to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder, widening      scope, but enjoying the freedom that   Scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,      that I have perceived nothing completely,   that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.   
   Even iron can put forth,   Even iron.   This is the iron age,   But let us take heart   Seeing iron break and bud,   Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.   The almond-tree,   December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.   The almond-tree,   That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake   In supreme bitterness.   Upon the iron, and upon the steel,   Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,   Odd crumbs of melting snow.   But you mistake, it is not from the sky;   From out the iron, and from out the steel,   Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,   Strange storming up from the dense under-earth   Along the iron, to the living steel   In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow   Setting supreme annunciation to the world.   Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,   Iron-breaking,   The rusty swords of almond-trees.   Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.   They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages   Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,   The alien trees in alien lands: and yet   The heart of blossom,   The unquenchable heart of blossom!   Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,   Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon   From the small wound-stump.   Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree   Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.   And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!   This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,   Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees   Iron, but unforgotten,   Iron, dawn-hearted,   Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.   See it come forth in blossom   From the snow-remembering heart   In long-nighted January,   In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.   Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane   Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.   Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom   And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!   Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,   Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,   So that the faith in his heart smiles again   And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,   And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,   Pearls itself into tenderness of bud   And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride   A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,   Frail-naked, utterly uncovered   To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind   And January's loud-seeming sun.   Think of it, from the iron fastness   Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.   Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,   With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.   Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,   Come forth from iron,   Red your heart is.   Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,   More fearless than iron all the time,   And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.   In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,   Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.   In the garden raying out   With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about   With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,   Sword-blade-born.   Unpromised,   No bounds being set.   Flaked out and come unpromised,   The tree being life-divine,   Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core   Within iron and earth.   Knots of pink, fish-silvery   In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,   Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,   Red at the core,   Red at the core,   Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.   Open,   Open,   Five times wide open,   Six times wide open,   And given, and perfect;   And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,   Sore-hearted-looking.   
"   At evening, sitting on this terrace,   When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara   Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...   When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing   Brown hills surrounding ...   When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio   A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,   Against the current of obscure Arno ...   Look up, and you see things flying   Between the day and the night;   Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.   A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches   Where light pushes through;   A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.   A dip to the water.   And you think:   ""The swallows are flying so late!""   Swallows?   Dark air-life looping   Yet missing the pure loop ...   A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight   And serrated wings against the sky,   Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,   And falling back.   Never swallows!Bats!   The swallows are gone.   At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats   By the Ponte Vecchio ...   Changing guard.   Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp   As the bats swoop overhead!   Flying madly.   Pipistrello!   Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.   Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;   Wings like bits of umbrella.   Bats!   Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;   And disgustingly upside down.   Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags   And grinning in their sleep.   Bats!   In China the bat is symbol for happiness.   Not for me!   "
   My love looks like a girl to-night,       But she is old. The plaits that lie along her pillow       Are not gold, But threaded with filigree silver,       And uncanny cold. She looks like a young maiden, since her brow       Is smooth and fair, Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.       She sleeps a rare Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed. Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams       Of perfect things. She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,       And her dead mouth sings By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.    
   This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green, Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes, Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes. I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration, Faces of people streaming across my gaze. And I, what fountain of fire am I among This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed About like a shadow buffeted in the throng Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.   
   I wish we could control this revolting   want of control: these people   with their spongy eyes, their mouths   of trembling shoehorns, billhooks for penises   and bear traps for vulvas.   One taste of sunlight and at once   they can’t do without it. Water,   the same, and food, and air,   and a dozen other squalid habits.   Some—like their copulation,   a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck—   are not physically compulsive but   the partners can’t stop wanting them to be:   so we desire to be raped   by love, who would fill us, they say,   with an oil from the lit braziers of stars.   What if, doing it every day,   we resemble pistons, and the slow poison   cuts our lives off at 70:   it’s the grim determination   of our passion. And beyond this, even I—   defended in childhood by my strong father   the piano and my mother the virtuoso   from knuckles among warehouses—even I   am addicted to the mild light of words.   
   You couples lying   where moon-scythes and day-scythes reaped you,   browning fruit falls and sleeps   in tangled nests, the wild grass,   falls from your apple tree that still grows here:   cry for your dead hero, his weak sword, his flight,   that you were slaughtered and your bed poured whiteness,   the issue of murdered marriage dawns.   The streets crack, a house falls open to the air,   sun and rain lie on the bed.   And the river still runs in a child’s hands   under the factory’s black hulk,   four stacks that used to bloom with smoke   over shining leaves, beneath thunderheads.   Then the storm   shatters and beats and after   in woods   a scented smoke of light,   a dripping quiet, and the small gold snake   sparkles at the pond’s edge.   But who is he? What were   the goods he made, what became of his loved wife,   his children, and where   has he gone, fearsome, powerless? The silver   path of air from the river’s bend to its rippling away   beneath the low concrete bridge   is still pure. No one comes, and the child   who watched by it has vanished.   Or sometimes he appears for a day, a night,   in the walls and windows reflected on the water,   in goldfinches’ flight, cricket song, the heron’s great   rise from the bank. Last a carp leaps,   voices and a lantern slide down the secret stream   in black and gold peace,   past the child’s husk, the family never born.   
   Child   one with the sun   in trackless fields   of yellow grass and thistle, scent   of humid heavy air and the wing music   of bees and flies.   Child, slender   nakedness to itself unknown,   true colour of the light   dispersed invisibly   or glowing around the black hulls   of distant thunderheads, around   the grasshopper’s countenance,   solemn, vigilant and wise.   Green apples, poured full   of density, of crispness, float unmoved   under leaves on the slope. Brown   fallen apples nest   in secret whorls of grass. The apple tree:   alone in so much space. And below   in the woods by the water   a sweet dead branch   cracks lightly   in the shadow in the wind.   But here is an old track   through the grass head-high   to a child: who   made it? They must have   passed and passed by this one tree,   by the abandoned, tireless car   where rabbits peer out, and the circle   of black embers,   cans, springs, skeletons   of furniture. They too   passed here many times   on their way from the street’s end   to the oaks that screen   the river. There   the sun is nesting now, night   rises with pale flutterings   of white wings from roots   of plants and the black water.   
            A courtier speaks to Ch’in Shih-huang-ti, ca. 210 B.C.            Highness, the former walls were helpless. They   stood alone in the middle of small fields   protecting nothing. A single peasant’s holding   engulfed each one as it ran briefly, straight   from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous steps   of broken stone at both ends. Only head-high,   without the towers, gates and towns of your great wall,   they stuck where they were, never rising over hills   or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy masonry   and a mystery: who built them, how long ago,   what for? They seemed to have no role but balking   the reaper and the ox; their bases made   islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild flowers   and shrubs sprouted.                                  So all the people praise you   for burying such walls and their memory   in your vast one, which joins them, stretching far   beyond where they once crumbled to hold your Empire:   a wall which therefore can never have an end   but has to go on extending itself forever.   How useful, how cogent your wall is: a pale   for the civilized, a dike against the wild people   outside, who trade their quiet human blood   for the rage of gods, tearing men to pieces,   throwing them, watching them fall. In burying   those little walls, Lord, you have covered our shame   at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty works   were so pointless, or so pitiably useless.   Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures?   So that some human work would rise over the flats   and weather till it seemed not human? Only   so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks:   docile-seeming, yet sullenly opposed   to use, and when compelled, only half serving,   reserving from the functions that we give them   a secret and idle self. The peasants would make   lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they served   for this alone.                           Now scholars, Lord, are saying   the gods are not bulls and cows. That in ancient times   we herded these animals to keep from starving   and going naked, and so came the old custom   of thinking them gods—from dependence. In my youth,   I know, the peasants said just the opposite.   Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow   were gathered to be adored more easily,   till people noticed how they let themselves   be driven and penned. Next came the first murders   against these gods, and the careful observation   that they stood to be killed. And so their cult became   contempt of beings that would live with us   and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we began   to breed them. That is why, the farmer says,   cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, cherished   with labour that makes him their slave, and that is why   in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with fear,   with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks into   stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted meat,   getting children, his house closed up with snow,   himself awake as if he slept, living   as if he had already died, and rich, happy   as if he were a buried worm.                                              Is God,   then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of cattle?   Myself, I don’t like to wonder anymore.   I only hope lifelong service earns what I ask:   the command of some far bastion on your wall   where it curves out into the unsettled wastes   beyond any field, and the barrenness inside   is indistinguishable from that without.   This is the reward and end of life I want:   to be a point, though infinitely small   and far from you, in that wide circle centred   on your great self. I see myself arriving   to take charge of my troops. I look down from the tower:   bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast restless   stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast,   the cold wind’s hissing. Year after year the same,   waiting for an assault that never comes,   straining to glimpse our naked enemies   creeping blended with their stony soil: nothing   but legend, it may be. Maybe a morning   will rise when, waking, I find that I’ve forgotten   which way is north, and can’t tell if I am turned   outward to danger or inward, Highness, to you.   The sun invisible, a murky light diffused   throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so long   no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight   endlessly east and west: what clue will there be   which way to face my people for the attack?   It will be crucial then to show no doubt.   My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.   
   We won’t pretend we’re not hungry for distinction   but what can ever distinguish us enough?   This country, this language won’t last long, the race   will die, later the cockroach, earth itself,   and last this beer bottle: silicon fused by man,   almost indestructible, like a soul:   it will go spinning ever farther from the nearest thing   until space, continually deepening, drowns in itself.   Yet we keep a hungry eye on old schoolmates   and everyone born in the year of our own birth,   and spend the nights in ranting over them,   their money, fashionable companions, pliant critics.   To live just a little longer than they do:   that would be triumph. Hence exercise and diets,   and the squabble over who will write the history   of this paradise of demons casting each other out.   
   Stiff, thick: the white hair of the broad-faced father,   who leads his shambling son along   cracked sidewalks, by dusty glass half hiding   goods never sold. The son is the taller one   but still a child: not aware of his clothes,   of what expressions seize on his soft face.   His gait lolls, loosely directed from some weak,   distant center, scarcely devoted to any purpose   but following along and looking. Thick lenses glint   with watery blue: his small eyes, veiled   and placid, as far off as the milky August sky.   The father, all the time glancing at him and talking   as man to man, seems to forget it would be better   for this one to have been like all the rest.   He has his son still with him, the others   have grown up and gone away—but when he dies,   then what will happen to the boy? Even this thought   is absorbed now in their ordinary errand,   men’s business: grateful going out through the day,   talk with the owners, the salesmen, a mechanic   in the scent of grease and sawdust of machined metal,   the sifting through tools and parts that flow, spill, gleam   like seeds, like sand—looking for what fits,   finding what will work. Afterwards to stop for food,   then walk back home down the clear streets, when starlings,   hunting and restless before sleep, and children   are the loudest things, with the dark foaming   among maples, glinting, as it comes in.   
   About the age of twenty, when the first hairfall   signals that nature is finished with the organism   and we just begin to conceive the use of women   (having been all this time   more enamored of the fountain than the cistern),   we retire to nursing homes,   whether they be kaleidoscopic gardens   aimed like a blunderbuss of hermeticism at our neighbors,   or a desperate dream safari through old Zambesi,   where the suicidal waves of angry natives   give the illusion that we are advancing rapidly,   or the crow’s-nest of this windless office block   where the cook is already boiling the last sail.   And sitting on the bench like a snowfall of beard   expectorated by a cloudy hat,   we consider the byproducts of life,   such as (to name only the least offensive to the nose)   the body itself when it has finally reached   that eminence from which all is visible   and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move on   to a homestead of its dreams like an abandoned chicken coop   on the sandy streamside under the tulip poplars,   and to words, which result from an instinct   for what is impossible:   to soften the blow for others, including ourselves.   
   Your parents had reached a long slow time,   as animals do, the great center of their lives,   when they gleam in their fells as though eternally,   unchanging. Or as a day can seem eternal   if you lie and watch the full clouds, conscious   of your own time: you soon must get up and leave.   So father, mother, the small shabby town,   its patch of earth going on as though forever: you   forgot them there, where they’d been since you started out   and where you could find them again—as anyone   forgets what he has to lean on   so deeply and heavily that it wounds his side   and the pain seems only himself.   Ungrateful? So you accused yourself one day,   waking suddenly. And when you went at last   to look for them where they always are, they’d gone,   or were withered alive, their mouths opening and closing   without sound. The buildings had leaned still farther   toward the dusty weeds and crumbs of old machines   littered everywhere inexplicably. And now   who will explain them? Your grandfather’s day   is as absent from your thought as is your own   gestation. And check the records:   what is written down says nothing.   The volumes all avoid the one question you have.   They’re like the notebooks you kept in adolescence:   you turn the endless pages and you wonder,   what did I know or feel, how did I live then,   what was this violence and love, this utter newness,   invention that could sing water and light, raging   at the first touch of dying, never mentioning death?   You went back and the bones of your native town   were like that, records from which something had escaped:   a skeletal mill that roofed ghostly technologies   where men once worked, coughed, burnt, bled.   And that way they had permitted the long pageants   of the children. And their mothers—whose images,   vague, identical, stalk by in the nights,   each one sorrowing and serene, her starved, enamelled,   hard flesh torn, her dress the blue of late dusk,   the heaven behind her a work of flat blinding gold.   
   Her hair back from the wide round face   flows, almost a girl’s, so thick,   caught back in combs, racing   and curling through them with blackest   vigor, although it is pure white.   Cracked face, dusk-colored: not red   but with a deep red struggling under   the coming night. The eyes shift quickly,   the subway train jerks and rattles,   green vinyl, light flickering, silver poles.   Eyes driven from ancient calm,   which may fear but is never frantic   and says nothing, such as looks out   from the old Indian portraits—calm is   the one thing missing from the beauty   of her face in the black window.   Those unresting eyes there   talk plainly: there’s no money   at home, men young and old go wrong,   life almost at its end is   still day by day harried and perplexed.   
"   Uncle Johnny died after rigid years of cutting hair in his shop downtown. Toward the end he cut it badly, breathing a whisky scent into the tonic, talc and glossy male curls piling up on the tiled floor. He died shrivelled, a man who seldom spoke, still with that nickname, Johnny, last taciturn hint of a youth who may have been angry, a lover of women, filled and lightened by vast ocean, the sky over America. He spent his time at home, silent, or sometimes in bars, or on the corner by King’s Newsstand with others like himself on sun-baked cement, spitting single words, standing in dark slacks, short-sleeved shirts and suspenders. The tall and narrow-waisted new world had by that time completely rejected suspenders. And after the funeral Mary, his wife, was crying and said to me, ""Why is it that the men always die sooner? Do they just give up?"" We stood there in the church of our fathers, who explained their own deaths, all death, by an ancient crime. How foolish it would have been to tell you, Mary, something about dioxyribonucleic acid, adaptation of the sexes, effects of the hormones, or social factors, things you’d listen to blankly. Better to say that what we find in ourselves, whatever weakness, we ourselves have put there. Both of us knew enough about men’s weakness. Your question didn’t need an answer: I simply shrugged and silently, without real hope, asked to be absolved from the fault of men: Powers of earth, give me the male strength that we desire, kindly strength, which protects. Don’t make my wife a nurse, helplessly to watch me dying drunk and before her. And do not punish me for pride because I’ve asked to be so strong: to be the last.   "
   When she rises in the morning I linger to watch her; She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window And the sunbeams catch her Glistening white on the shoulders, While down her sides the mellow Golden shadow glows as She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts Sway like full-blown yellow Gloire de Dijon roses. She drips herself with water, and her shoulders Glisten as silver, they crumple up Like wet and falling roses, and I listen For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals. In the window full of sunlight Concentrates her golden shadow Fold on fold, until it glows as Mellow as the glory roses.    
   What large, dark hands are those at the window   Lifted, grasping the golden light   Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves          To my heart's delight?   Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,   In the west I see a redness come   Over the evening's burning breast —          — 'Tis the wound of love goes home!   The woodbine creeps abroad   Calling low to her lover:   The sun-lit flirt who all the day   Has poised above her lips in play   And stolen kisses, shallow and gay   Of pollen, now has gone away   — She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,   And when above her his broad wings hover   Then her bright breast she will uncover   And yield her honey-drop to her lover.   Into the yellow, evening glow   Saunters a man from the farm below,   Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed   Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.   The bird lies warm against the wall.   She glances quick her startled eyes   Towards him, then she turns away   Her small head, making warm display   Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway   Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,   Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies   In one blue stoop from out the sties   Into the evening's empty hall.   Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes   Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,   Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,   Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.   The rabbit presses back her ears,   Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes   And crouches low: then with wild spring   Spurts from the terror of his oncoming   To be choked back, the wire ring   Her frantic effort throttling:   Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!   Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,   And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.   Yet calm and kindly are his eyes   And ready to open in brown surprise   Should I not answer to his talk   Or should he my tears surmise.   I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair   Watching the door open: he flashes bare   His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes   In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise   He flings the rabbit soft on the table board   And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword   Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad   Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud   His coming: he raises up my face to him   And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim   Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!   I know not what fine wire is round my throat,   I only know I let him finger there   My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat   Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:   And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down   His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood   Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood   Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown   Within him, die, and find death good.   
   The very longest swell in the ocean, I suspect,   carries the deepest memory, the information of actions   summarized (surface peaks and dibbles and local sharp   slopes of windstorms) with a summary of the summaries   and under other summaries a deeper summary: well, maybe   deeper, longer for length here is the same as deep   time: so that the longest swell swells least; that   is, its effects in immediate events are least perceptible,   a pitch to white water rising say a millimeter more   because of an old invisible presence: and on the ocean   floor an average so vast occurs it moves in a noticeability   of a thousand years, every blip, though, of surface and   intermediacy moderated into account: I like to go   to old places where the effect dwells, summits or seas   so hard to summon into mind, even with the natural   ones hard to climb or weigh: I go there in my mind   (which is, after all, where these things negotiably are)   and tune in to the wave nearly beyond rise or fall in its   staying and hum the constant, universal assimilation: the   information, so packed, nearly silenced with majesty   and communicating hardly any action: go there and   rest from the ragged and rapid pulse, the immediate threat   shot up in a disintegrating spray, the many thoughts and   sights unmanageable, the deaths of so many, hungry or mad.   
   This is just a place:   we go around, distanced,   yearly in a star’s   atmosphere, turning   daily into and out of   direct light and   slanting through the   quadrant seasons: deep   space begins at our   heels, nearly rousing   us loose: we look up   or out so high, sight’s      silk almost draws us away:   this is just a place:   currents worry themselves   coiled and free in airs   and oceans: water picks   up mineral shadow and   plasm into billions of   designs, frames: trees,   grains, bacteria: but   is love a reality we   made here ourselves—   and grief—did we design   that—or do these,   like currents, whine   in and out among us merely   as we arrive and go:   this is just a place:   the reality we agree with,   that agrees with us,   outbounding this, arrives   to touch, joining with   us from far away:   our home which defines   us is elsewhere but not   so far away we have      forgotten it:   this is just a place.   
   Love has crept into her sealed heart As a field bee, black and amber, Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start. Love has crept into her summery eyes, And a glint of colored sunshine brings Such as his along the folded wings Of the bee before he flies. But I with my ruffling, impatient breath Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite; He has opened them out in a reeling flight, And down her words he hasteneth. Love flies delighted in her voice: The hum of his glittering, drunken wings Sets quivering with music the little things That she says, and her simple words rejoice.    
   I don’t know somehow it seems sufficient   to see and hear whatever coming and going is,   losing the self to the victory      of stones and trees,   of bending sandpit lakes, crescent   round groves of dwarf pine:   for it is not so much to know the self      as to know it as it is known      by galaxy and cedar cone,   as if birth had never found it   and death could never end it:   the swamp’s slow water comes      down Gravelly Run fanning the long         stone-held algal   hair and narrowing roils between      the shoulders of the highway bridge:   holly grows on the banks in the woods there,      and the cedars’ gothic-clustered      spires could make   green religion in winter bones:   so I look and reflect, but the air’s glass      jail seals each thing in its entity:   no use to make any philosophies here:      I see no   god in the holly, hear no song from   the snowbroken weeds: Hegel is not the winter      yellow in the pines: the sunlight has never      heard of trees: surrendered self among      unwelcoming forms: stranger,   hoist your burdens, get on down the road.   
            This sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the Mongolian camel.            “Fancy-schmancy,” my father would have said,      whose snazziest sweater was still a declassé      synthetic from the sweatshops of Taiwan. My friend      Deloris, however, who really owns such clothes,      would say “exquisite” or “sublime”—her opened closet’s      row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight      along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain      and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more      than her wardrobe’s tasteful accessories. “. . . woven      from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then      hand-sewn in our undersea domes.” “Untouched      by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . .”   ______________Rarefied—to Helthi Hart, the diet guru, it’s      a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. And for      the Emperor Excessia, it’s a mad dessert of swans’ tongues      —there were, what? ten thousand?—dipped in a slip      of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers      like a field of fresh shoots they could graze.      Some Roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow      brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests      with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe.      They might even allow the household slaves to slide      leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate      into their shoulders all down the mountainside.      ______________         Afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter.      But an image of my father’s worn-thin Bargain City      “all-weather” jacket is still whole in its polyester glory.      This is what happened: the alley dog (he later called the thing      a “cur”) had cornered Livia, and she screamed once,      with a seven-year-old’s unselfconscious terror.      And then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm,      and a rock. When it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog      quiet and, after comforting Livia, they both kneeled down      to comfort the dog. He was like that. And the jacket      that served as weapon and restraint?—was like him,      every day of his life. It did what was needed.      ______________   I misread “migraine.” Which of the two      would we call the most rarefied? “Margarine”?      Or maybe comparison isn’t the point. A ghost      is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander   death; that doesn’t make, for most of us, extinction      an ideal. It was hard to think of Frank and Deloris      divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them      engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy      with the rest of the hoi polloi. They seemed unearthly      in close to a literal way, like radio waves. And yet divorce   they did. They found something real they could unjoin,      hertz from hertz until there just was air.      ______________   A dream: We own the softest of the soft      Mongolian camel underhair sweaters. One day      (we think we’re doing the “right thing”) we release it      into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister      desert sweaters, out where it “belongs.”   You know, however, what happens by now: it’s unfit      to fend for itself amid that hardened herd.      They beat it. It’s hungry. It crawls back      into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door      my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside,      wraps it in flannel. That’s how he was.      He’d give you the cheap shirt off his back.   
   At the table, at the grave not knowing whether to grieve or celebrate, they seemed to find a way within the stalled noon clatter and the dusk over oily swamps and elder tangle along a locked stockade of heavy machines, as the blue heron, looking down, flew farther on. Nothing dissolved for them the mortal green and black in transparent power of spacious streams now gone from earth. The flickering they found, terror-hope-terror, in fire of sunset clouds remained unwavering in its progress to night and day and night. And yet the pleasure they took in everything did not wear out. The limestone quarry of a poorer century, lipped in birds and berries, treasured up, still treasures up, old rains beneath its surface of dusty jet— still waits behind their houses on airless nights to be the dreams and drownings of new children.   
   The man was white, grey and pale brown, the colorless colors of a used-up earth where water has sunk down, sunk down so low and risen so far above the grey-white pale-brown heaven and shrunk so far within itself that it will not come back. What can moisten a shriveled water, or can a clod of ash regain colors from the identical howl of a white powder sun? Not in me, he said, ever again, but in the street with engine and worker petals, not papery, more fragile than that, there will be color. My eye will reach color, all colors, every one together, which no one will see in me ever again. I turned to the sky then and it was all one blue, the color of seeing, and yet was as many blues, as subtle, as tones of stubble in the most sunken cheek.   
   Did wind and wave design the albatross's wing, honed compliances: or is it effrontery to suggest that the wing designed the gales and seas: are we guests here, then, with all the gratitude and soft-walking of the guest: provisions and endurances of riverbeds, mountain shoulders, windings through of tulip poplar, grass, and sweet-frosted foxgrape: are we to come into these and leave them as they are: are the rivers in us, and the slopes, ours that the world's imitate, or are we mirrorments merely of a high designing aloof and generous as a host to us: what would become of us if we declined and staked out a level affirmation of our own: we wind the brook into our settlement and husband the wind to our sails and blades: what is to be grateful when let alone to itself, as for a holiday in naturalness: the albatross, ah, fishes the waves with a will beyond the waves' will, and we, to our own doings, put down the rising of sea or mountain slope: except we do not finally put it down: still, till the host appears, we'll make the masters here.   
   Such a long time as the wave idling gathers lofts and presses forward into the curvature of the height before one realizes that the tension completes itself with a fall through air, disorganization the prelude to the meandering of another gather and hurl, the necessary: ah, what can one make to absorb the astonishment: you should have seen me the merchant at market this morning: the people ogled me with severe goggles: maids, buying in manners and measures beyond themselves, stared into my goods and then grew horror-eyed: wives still as distant from day as a carrot from dinner took the misconnection sagely, a usual patience: peashells, I said, long silky peashells: cobs, I said, long cobs: husks and shucks, I said: one concerned person pointed out that my whole economy was wrong; yes, I said, but I have nothing else to sell: and I said to her, won't you appreciate the silky beds where seeds have lain: she had not come to that: and how about this residence all the grains have left: won't you buy it and think about it: not for dinner, she said: rinds, I cried, rinds and peelings: there was some interest in those, as for a marmalade, but no one willing, finally, to do the preparations: absurd, one woman shouted, and then I grew serious: can you do with that: but she was off before we fully met: you should have seen me the merchant at market this morning: will bankruptcy make a go of it: will the leavings be left only: the wave turns over and does not rise again, that wave.   
   Does she love you? She says yes, but really how do you know unless you undress that easy assertion, undoing its petals and laminae, and going in below all trace of consciousness, into the neuroelectrical coffer where self-understanding is storaged away, and then lifting its uttermost molecule out, to study in its nakedness as it spins in a clinical light?—the way we all, in our various individual versions of this common human urge, go in, and in, and in, the physicist down to the string-vibration underlying matter, and   the Appalachia fiddler getting so (as she puts it) “into my music,” sound becomes a flesh for her to intimately (“in”-timately) enter, “its thick and its sweetbreads.”Is he cheating on you? He says no, and feigns that he’s insulted, but for certainty you’ll need to delicately strip the bark away and drill, and tweeze, until you can smear a microscope slide of the pith and can augur the chitterlings —the way the philosopher can’t accept a surface assumption of truth, but needs to peel back   the fatty sheen of the dermis, soak the cambium layer into a blow-away foam, and then with pick and lightbeam helmet, inch by inch begin spelunking through those splayed-out caverns under the crust, where gems of cogitation are buried —the way the diver descends for the pearl, the miner: in, the archaeologist: in, the therapist: down the snakier roots of us and in, and in, the way the lone, leg-pretzeled yogi makes a glowing bathysphere of worldliness and sends it in, and further in, tinier and heavier and ever in, the way the man in the opium den is floating forever, toward a horizon positioned in the center of the center of his head. . . . If we could stand beyond the border of our species and consider us objectively, it might seem that our purpose in existing is to be a living agency that balances, or maybe even slows, the universe’s irreversible expansion out, and out . . . and each of us, a contribution to that task. My friend John’s wife received the news: a “growth,” a “mass,” on her pituitary, marble-sized, mysterious. And the primary-care physician said: Yes, we must go in and in. That couldn’t be the final word! And the second-opinion physician said: Yes, my sweet-and-shivering-one, my fingerprint-and-irisprint-uniqueness, someone’s-dearest, you who said the prayers at Juliette’s grave, who drove all night from Switzerland with your daughter, you on this irreplaceable day in your irreplaceable skin in the scumbled light as it crosses the bay in Corpus Christi, yes in the shadows, yes in the radiance, yes we must go in and in.   
            During Napoleon iii’s coup d’état one of  his officers, Count de Saint-Arnaud, on being informed that a mob was approaching the Imperial Guard, coughed and exclaimed, with his hand across his throat, “Ma sacrée toux! (my damned cough).” But his lieutenant, understanding him to say “Massacrez tous! (massacre them all),” gave the order to fire, killing thousands—needlessly.                    —Guy Murchie            “He was mortared to death.” A pity, how we misspeak and mishear. —Or “martyred”? Not that/coin-flip/either makes a difference to the increasingly cooler downtick of a corpse’s cells. “We heard the crazy mating joy of the loon across the water.” Yes, but what do
   I’m sitting at Nathan’s, reading a biography of Darwinwho, right now, is dissecting a barnacle“no bigger than a pinhead (and with two penises)”:he’ll work like this on barnacles, his wrists supportedby rigged-up blocks of workshop wood, for eight years.Nathan is reading too, in the worn-down banged-up “daddy chair”:those philosophical poems of William Bronk’s. What’smost delightful is that Tristan, eleven, and Aidan, ten,are reading, each of them enmazed in a fantasy novelthat squeezes them by the attention-bone behind the eyesin its thimble pool of pineal juice and drizzled endorphins.Tristan cared enough to cry when he finished his previous bookand its battle of shadow and radiance was over.Each of us: his individual book; and yetthe silence is communal. This is a natural stateat Nathan’s. Holly, however, is reading the Sunday paperand so serves, without saying a word, to remind ushow natural it was for Raeshawn Nelson, seven,to fall while running and burn out his eyeon the disregarded meth pipe, or for Anna Rietta, nine,to have come home from school and excitedly been the **!star!**, each day, of the homemade porn her parentspeddled as “young fun” over the Internet. Thiswas what they knew, and all they knew, and so they entered itas comfortably as Tristan does his opened worldof sorcerors and valiant knights and fancy-talking beasts, since usex frequency = familiarity. That’s the strict, imperious mathof everybody’s insular subuniverse. Sherena asked me whatthis thing “vermouth” was (she pronounced it “mouth”) and orderedquiche as if it were the brother of “touché”; but thenshe needed to explain to me why C-C was the “bottom bitch”and what a “T-girl” is and how to put down moneyon Ice’s book at “the county,” by whichshe meant jail. And those years when Darwin parsedthe slimy fiber of his barnacles (discovering the specieswhere “the female has no anus” and the one with “tiny parasiticmales [that were] embedded in one female’s flesh like blackheads”),“squinty . . . laborious,” were among the final decades of hundreds of yearswhen a woman in China would suffer ritual foot binding,at five, the bandages limiting growth until the toeswere bent and curled (the toenails growing into the balls of the feet)and the arches broken. This resulted in the desirable“shrunken plums” and “three-inch golden lilies” soughtby marriage brokers. Traditionally, a prospective mother-in-lawwould check below the hem, and reject any feetover four inches long. Entire generations of women could only mince and hobble. And this was natural, this was the airand the light and “the-way-of-things-forever” thatyou woke up to every day . . . as natural as the implicit lawsin Aidan’s book, by which a bear converseswith a girl in growly mutual-speak, and a boyof sturdy heart and his wingéd horse ascendtheir sky with the unremarkable grace of birdsin ours. That’s ordinary Newtonian physics there, and Aidansubjects himself to the rules of flying horsemanship,and the code of those of innocent spiritabout to war with wyverns and the wormfolk, andthe governing instructions of gods with the headsof wide-eyed animals . . . and even now, Sherena textsmy phone to say that WEATHER GOOD and SHINEGOT BULLET IN LUNG FROM POLICE
   Version 1 (1921) Yours is the shame and sorrow,       But the disgrace is mine; Your love was dark and thorough, Mine was the love of the sun for a flower       He creates with his shine. I was diligent to explore you,       Blossom you stalk by stalk, Till my fire of creation bore you Shrivelling down in the final dour       Anguish — then I suffered a balk. I knew your pain, and it broke       My fine, craftsman's nerve; Your body quailed at my stroke, And my courage failed to give you the last       Fine torture you did deserve. You are shapely, you are adorned,       But opaque and dull in the flesh, Who, had I but pierced with the thorned Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast       In a lovely illumined mesh. Like a painted window: the best       Suffering burnt through your flesh, Undrossed it and left it blest With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now       Who shall take you afresh? Now who will burn you free       From your body's terrors and dross, Since the fire has failed in me? What man will stoop in your flesh to plough       The shrieking cross? A mute, nearly beautiful thing       Is your face, that fills me with shame As I see it hardening, Warping the perfect image of God,       And darkening my eternal fame. Version 2 (1928) Yours is the sullen sorrow,       The disgrace is also mine; Your love was intense and thorough, Mine was the love of a growing flower       For the sunshine. You had the power to explore me, Blossom me stalk by stalk; You woke my spirit, you bore me To consciousness, you gave me the dour       Awareness — then I suffered a balk. Body to body I could not       Love you, although I would. We kissed, we kissed though we should not. You yielded, we threw the last cast,       And it was no good. You only endured, and it broke       My craftsman's nerve. No flesh responded to my stroke; So I failed to give you the last       Fine torture you did deserve. You are shapely, you are adorned       But opaque and null in the flesh; Who, had I but pierced with the thorned Full anguish, perhaps had been cast       In a lovely illuinined mesh Like a painted window; the best       Fire passed through your flesh, Undrossed it, and left it blest In clean new awareness. But now       Who shall take you afresh? Now who will burn you free       From your body's deadness and dross? Since the fire has failed in me, What man will stoop in your flesh to plough       The shrieking cross? A mute, nearly beautiful thing       Is your face, that fills me with shame As I see it hardening; I should have been cruel enough to bring       You through the flame.    
   Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me; Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings. In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano our guide. So now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamour With the great black piano appassionato. The glamour Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.    
"   She is large and matronly And rather dirty, A little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had driven her to it. Though what she does, except lay four eggs at random in the garden once a year And put up with her husband, I don't know. She likes to eat. She hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny legs, When food is going. Oh yes, she can make haste when she likes. She snaps the soft bread from my hand in great mouthfuls, Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron, pristine face Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth Like sudden curved scissors, And gulping at more than she can swallow, and working her thick, soft tongue, And having the bread hanging over her chin. O Mistress, Mistress, Reptile Mistress, Your eye is very dark, very bright, And it never softens Although you watch. She knows, She knows well enough to come for food, Yet she sees me not; Her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything, Sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless, Reptile mistress. Taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless mouth, She has no qualm when she catches my finger in her steel overlapping gums, But she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking are nothing to her, She does not even know she is nipping me with her curved beak. Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag it in horror away. Mistress, reptile mistress, You are almost too large, I am almost frightened. He is much smaller, Dapper beside her, And ridiculously small. Her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look, His, poor darling, is almost fiery. His wimple, his blunt-prowed face, His low forehead, his skinny neck, his long, scaled, striving legs, So striving, striving, Are all more delicate than she, And he has a cruel scar on his shell. Poor darling, biting at her feet, Running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy, splay feet, Nipping her ankles, Which she drags apathetic away, though without retreating into her shell. Agelessly silent, And with a grim, reptile determination, Cold, voiceless age-after-age behind him, serpents' long obstinacy Of horizontal persistence. Little old man Scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his opportunity, Parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and seizing her scaly ankle, And hanging grimly on, Letting go at last as she drags away, And closing his steel-trap face. His steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face. Alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle. And how he feels it! The lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker through chaos, The immune, the animate, Enveloped in isolation, Forerunner. Now look at him! Alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation. His adolescence saw him crucified into sex, Doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek his consummation beyond himself. Divided into passionate duality, He, so finished and immune, now broken into desirous fragmentariness, Doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself In his effort toward completion again. Poor little earthy house-inhabiting Osiris, The mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into pieces, And he must struggle after reconstruction, ignominiously. And so behold him following the tail Of that mud-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse, Like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow, But with more than bovine, grim, earth-dank persistence, Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches out to walk, Roaming over the sods, Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell. Their two shells like domed boats bumping, Hers huge, his small; Their splay feet rambling and rowing like paddles, And stumbling mixed up in one another, In the race of love — Two tortoises, She huge, he small. She seems earthily apathetic, And he has a reptile's awful persistence. I heard a woman pitying her, pitying the Mère Tortue. While I, I pity Monsieur. ""He pesters her and torments her,"" said the woman. How much more is he pestered and tormented, say I. What can he do? He is dumb, he is visionless, Conceptionless. His black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not As her earthen mound moves on, But he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery skin, Nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell, And drags at these with his beak, Drags and drags and bites, While she pulls herself free, and rows her dull mound along.    "
   When did you start your tricks   Monsieur?   What do you stand on such high legs for?   Why this length of shredded shank   You exaltation?   Is it so that you shall lift your centre of gravity upwards   And weigh no more than air as you alight upon me,   Stand upon me weightless, you phantom?   I heard a woman call you the Winged Victory   In sluggish Venice.   You turn your head towards your tail, and smile.   How can you put so much devilry   Into that translucent phantom shred   Of a frail corpus?   Queer, with your thin wings and your streaming legs   How you sail like a heron, or a dull clot of air,   A nothingness.   Yet what an aura surrounds you;   Your evil little aura, prowling, and casting a numbness on my mind.   That is your trick, your bit of filthy magic:   Invisibility, and the anæsthetic power   To deaden my attention in your direction.   But I know your game now, streaky sorcerer.   Queer, how you stalk and prowl the air   In circles and evasions, enveloping me,   Ghoul on wings   Winged Victory.   Settle, and stand on long thin shanks   Eyeing me sideways, and cunningly conscious that I am aware,   You speck.   I hate the way you lurch off sideways into air   Having read my thoughts against you.   Come then, let us play at unawares,   And see who wins in this sly game of bluff.   Man or mosquito.   You don't know that I exist, and I don't know that you exist.   Now then!   It is your trump   It is your hateful little trump   You pointed fiend,   Which shakes my sudden blood to hatred of you:   It is your small, high, hateful bugle in my ear.   Why do you do it?   Surely it is bad policy.   They say you can't help it.   If that is so, then I believe a little in Providence protecting the innocent.   But it sounds so amazingly like a slogan   A yell of triumph as you snatch my scalp.   Blood, red blood   Super-magical   Forbidden liquor.   I behold you stand   For a second enspasmed in oblivion,   Obscenely ecstasied   Sucking live blood   My blood.   Such silence, such suspended transport,   Such gorging,   Such obscenity of trespass.   You stagger   As well as you may.   Only your accursed hairy frailty   Your own imponderable weightlessness   Saves you, wafts you away on the very draught my anger makes in its snatching.   Away with a pæan of derision   You winged blood-drop.   Can I not overtake you?   Are you one too many for me   Winged Victory?   Am I not mosquito enough to out-mosquito you?   Queer, what a big stain my sucked blood makes   Beside the infinitesimal faint smear of you!   Queer, what a dim dark smudge you have disappeared into!   
   Making his advances He does not look at her, nor sniff at her, No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank. Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin That work beneath her while she sprawls along In her ungainly pace, Her folds of skin that work and row Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves. And so he strains beneath her housey walls And catches her trouser-legs in his beak Suddenly, or her skinny limb, And strange and grimly drags at her Like a dog, Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency. Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed. Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation And doomed to partiality, partial being, Ache, and want of being, Want, Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her. Born to walk alone, Forerunner, Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track, This awkward, harrowing pursuit, This grim necessity from within. Does she know As she moves eternally slowly away? Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window, All knowledgeless? The awful concussion, And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue, Driven, after æons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness, At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron, Driven away from himself into her tracks, Forced to crash against her. Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile, Little gentleman, Sorry plight, We ought to look the other way. Save that, having come with you so far, We will go on to the end.    
   I thought he was dumb, I said he was dumb, Yet I've heard him cry. First faint scream, Out of life's unfathomable dawn, Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim, Far, far off, far scream. Tortoise in extremis. Why were we crucified into sex? Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves, As we began, As he certainly began, so perfectly alone? A far, was-it-audible scream, Or did it sound on the plasm direct? Worse than the cry of the new-born, A scream, A yell, A shout, A pæan, A death-agony, A birth-cry, A submission, All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn. War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian, Why was the veil torn? The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane? The male soul's membrane Torn with a shriek half music, half horror. Crucifixion. Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female, Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell In tortoise-nakedness, Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof, And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls, Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh! Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck And giving that fragile yell, that scream, Super-audible, From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth, Giving up the ghost, Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost. His scream, and his moment's subsidence, The moment of eternal silence, Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once The inexpressible faint yell — And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret. So he tups, and screams Time after time that frail, torn scream After each jerk, the longish interval, The tortoise eternity, Agelong, reptilian persistence, Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm. I remember, when I was a boy, I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake; I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring; I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters; I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul; I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight; I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible; I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats; I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing, And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb, The first wail of an infant, And my mother singing to herself, And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death, The first elements of foreign speech On wild dark lips. And more than all these, And less than all these, This last, Strange, faint coition yell Of the male tortoise at extremity, Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life. The cross, The wheel on which our silence first is broken, Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence Tearing a cry from us. Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement, Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found. Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost, The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment, That which is whole, torn asunder, That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.    
   There are four men mowing down by the Isar; I can hear the swish of the scythe-strokes, four Sharp breaths taken: yea, and I Am sorry for what's in store. The first man out of the four that's mowing Is mine, I claim him once and for all; Though it's sorry I am, on his young feet, knowing None of the trouble he's led to stall. As he sees me bringing the dinner, he lifts His head as proud as a deer that looks Shoulder-deep out of the corn; and wipes His scythe-blade bright, unhooks The scythe-stone and over the stubble to me. Lad, thou hast gotten a child in me, Laddie, a man thou'lt ha'e to be, Yea, though I'm sorry for thee.    
   The great gold apples of night Hang from the street's long bough       Dripping their light On the faces that drift below, On the faces that drift and blow Down the night-time, out of sight       In the wind's sad sough. The ripeness of these apples of night Distilling over me       Makes sickening the white Ghost-flux of faces that hie Them endlessly, endlessly by Without meaning or reason why       They ever should be.   
   John-O was given a key to the apartment. The deal   was this: if Phil died suddenly, and John-O heard,   he would rush on over, enter the apartment, leave   unseen with Phil’s brown suitcase, and secretly pitch it   into the mounded deeps of the city dump.   Simply, there were things that Phil didn’t want   to hurt his family with. Do you have yours?   I have mine. The brown suitcase. Sasha’s sister,   on her deathbed—dinky, frail, just a mild   skim-milk trickle of a hospice patient—   tensed, sat up, and unloosed   such confessional invective that it seemed the walls   and the sheets would have to be splattered in shit,   her cancer having acted with the harsh, disbursing   force of a tornado on the brown and hard-shelled   suitcase in her electrochemical memory webs.   Is yours secure? from love? from sodium pentathol?   Last year, when a tornado hit our fringe   of downtown businesses, the air was alive for counties around   with the downward dance of naked canceled checks,   handwritten notes, hotel receipts, e-mail transcripts,   smeary Polaroids, a swirl of lacy underwisps   that jellyfished the skies, and from The G-Spot Shoppe   a rain of plastic pleasure aids, of which one prime example   pierced a cow between the eyes and struck her dead.   Maybe AIDS—I wasn’t sure. But he was dying,that was sure: as dry as a stick of human chalk,   and making the terrible scritch-sound of a stick of chalk,   in his throat, in the community air, in the room   across from Sasha’s sister. Something . . . hidden   in the trace of rundown aura still around him   as we chatted there one morning . . . a tv? a sissyboy tv?   I wasn’t sure, but it was obvious   his life-chalk held a story not yet written,   not confessed yet   for this storyniverous planet.   And when I remembered my mother’s own   last days . . . the way a person is a narrative,   the strength of which is either   revelation or withholding. It was summer, and the garden   at the nursing home was fat with summer’s pleasures:   flowered mounds like reefs of coral,   bees as globular as whole yolks.   In her room, my mother disappeared a breath   at a time, and everything else was only a kind of scenery for that.   The wink of pollen in the light. The birds. Their feather-lice.   The bursting spores. Those opened-up   cicada husks abandoned on the patio   —the small, brown, unlocked luggage   that’s completed its work in this world.   
   It's the other ones, who soon enough return  to being happy after the funeral, that are nearest  to their own deaths—in their gaiety  and everyday distraction, they're so open  and unguarded . . . anything could enter them;  could claim them. It's the ones who weep  incessantly that are saved for now, the ones  who have taken a little of it  into their systems: this is how  inoculation works. And sorrow is difficult,  a job: it requires time to complete.  And the tears?—the salt  of the folk saying,  that gets sprinkled over the tail feathers  and keeps a bird from flying;  keeps it stationed in this world.   
   Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe  does the summer when I was seventeen come back  to mind against my will, like a bird crossing  my vision. Summer of moist nights full of girls  and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation  of the comic boundaries, defiances that never  failed or brought disaster. Days on the backs  and in the breath of horses, between rivers  and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,  enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves  over muscular water. All those things accepted,  once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant  accepts the nipple, never come back to mind  against the will. What comes unsummoned now,  blotting out every other thought and image,  is a part of the past not so deep or far away:  the time of poverty, of struggle to find means  not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.  What returns are those moments in the diner  night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,  watching an old man, who always at the same hour  came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened  his drawing pad. What did he fill it with?  And where's he gone? Those days, that studious worker,  hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,  that artist always in the same worn-out suit,  are my nostalgia now. That old man comes back,  the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,  because I hoped soon to disappear from there,  as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.   
   You that I loved all my life long, you are not the one. You that I followed, my line or path or way, that I followed singing, and you earth and air of the world the way went through, and you who stood around it so it could be the way, you forests and cities, you deer and opossums struck by the lonely hunter and left decaying, you paralyzed obese ones who sat on a falling porch in a deep green holler and observed me, your bald dog barking, as I stumbled past in a hurry along my line, you are not the one. But you are the one, you that I loved all my life long, you I still love so in my dying mind I grasp me loving you when we are gone. You are the one, you path or way or line that winds beside the house where she and I live on, still longing though long gone for the health of all forests and cities, and one day to visit them, one day be rich and free enough to go and see the restricted wonders of the earth. And you are the one, old ladies fated from birth to ugliness, obesity and dearth, who sat beside my path one day as I flashed by. And you are the one, all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills and animals the car on the road kills and leaves stinking in the sun.   
   Here comes the wise man in the story of sick times,  telling you how to find the passage of satisfaction.  He is many million years old and has been walking  many thousand miles, more miles, more lengths of road  than the shrunk-up earth of these days possesses,  to find you. He has a veda from before creation  to sing you and, lo and behold, it is about you,  it means everything to you. Though they’ve made a rope  out of rough, heavy smoke, like a whale-thick hawser  for a steamer of dead star, and pulled it through you  from throat to crotch, from ear to ear, and hag-tied  your hands and feet with the ends, though each of them  has your own face molten with leprosy,  though your brain makes the sound of crowded trains  colliding in Kashmir and a stadium that roars hosanna,  it is still possible now, in the next moment, to know God.  That is, not die in confusion. But maybe, then, this guru  is too soon. Maybe he hasn’t come from far enough.  Maybe he’s still much too young. Maybe he’s never  asked himself clearly what happens when someone like you  hears that a lightning-opened living fig tree or a mountain  and a blue sky can be lived in and sets out  on the long road never moving from his realm in pain.   
            We know far more about the philosophical underpinnings of Puritanism than we do about what its practitioners consumed at countless meals.  —James Deetz            1 Yes. So we must reconnect   ideas of God, and the definitions of “liberty,”   and the psychology of our earliest models of governance, with   oyster peeces in barley beer & wheet, chopt cod & venyson seethed in a blood broth,   hominy pottage, also squirell.   Their heads might well have brimmed with heaven   and its airborne personnel, but still their mouths were a mash   of white meat [cheese] and a motley collation of eel leavings, a fine samp, and a roast Fowl.   Worshipp first, then after—butter Biskuits! David Ignatow:   “seeking transcendence   but loving bread”   2 And it is too easy to get lost in abstraction,   as if smoke, and dream, and quantum ersatz-states   are our proper environment... it’s easy to conceptualize in “politics”   and not in the clack of the black or white dried bean   we drop in the voting bowl. In some tribes, there’s a designated   “reminderer,” and when the shaman novitiate—or sometimes   simply a mournful family member—follows the star trail   into the country of ghosts, and lingers there, this person tugs   the wanderer back home: perhaps a light thwack   with a broom-shock, or the rising steam of a broth that one   can hungrily shinny down to Earth like a rope.   In the Mesopotamian Inanna myth, it’s water and bread   that resurrect the goddess and allow her   to begin the long ascent out from the craters of Hell.   We can spend all day, and many days, and years, in theorizing.   “A Computer Recreation of Proto-Hominid Dietary Intake:    An Analysis”   ... we’ll float off, through these foggy lands of argot,   in the way that someone else might dissolve in the blue cloud   of an opium den... no wonder there’s such pleasure in uncovering   the solid fossil record of those appetites, and in emptying out   its evidence grain by grain, a stone piñata. How often   the stories bring us back to that grounding! In 1620,   a first exploratory party from the Mayflower went ashore   on the northern Cape Cod coast. The weather was bad   and disorienting: a half a foot of snow, in air   so thick as to be directionless. But we sense they recouped   their spirits that night, from three fat Geese  and six Ducks whitch we ate with Soldiers stomackes. 3  And it is too easy to lose ourselves in cyberthink,   untethered from the touchable, from even the cohesive force   suffusing through one atom. “What we keep,”   reports an archivist at the New York Times, “is the information,   not the paper”... everything e-storaged now.   A thousand years of pages, pffft: dismissiveness   as obliterative as a bonfire, in the long run. Oh, yes,   easy to cease to exist as an actual shape, inside the huge,   occluding mists of legalese: we say “repatriation   of native archeological remains,” and we mean   human bones, that’s what we mean: hard and dear   and contested. We say “ritual signifier of threat,” but   what the Narragansetts sent to the colonists at Plymouth   was a bundl of thair Arrows tyed about in a mightie Snake skin. I died. And I was stolen  into a land of strangers—of not-the-People.   I floated all day, many days. And here  the ribs of my cage were empty: always  I was hungry, for the things that People need.   But this was not the sun, and this was not the soil, of the People; and I was restless, I had no one  for between my legs, and no drum in my chest. There was much war from this: the People  desired me back, they said “this one is part of many-ones,” and after words and words,   their word was so. One day the breezes sent the fishes and savory beaver parts, and I knew at last that I was home: my mouth of my skull watered.   4 “When hegemonic identity-structures systemize cognition—” whoa.   There are times I think my friends might flimmer away in that   high-minded mush... and I concentrate, then, on the names   of those people from 1621, names that are true, specific   labor and specific, beautiful common things. Cooper.   Fletcher. Glover. Miller. Glazer. Mason. Carpenter.   Cheerfull Winter.   Oceanus Hopkins.   Lydia Fish, Nathaniel Fish and Steadfast Fish, of Sandwich.   Zachariah Field, father, and daughter Dutiful Field.   Pandora Sparrow.   Who wouldn’t care to meet Peregrine Soule?   And who could wish to let go of this life   when faced by Countenance Bountie?
